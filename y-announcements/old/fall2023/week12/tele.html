As you can tell, I&rsquo;ve been a little under the weather, so my voice is a little rough. I apologize for that. This week we&rsquo;ve got a discussion three coming up with Sarah Allen. She&rsquo;ll be here next Thursday, so please make sure you mark that on your calendar. You&rsquo;ve got until next Wednesday to come up with a couple of questions. You&rsquo;d like to ask Sarah based on her experience working as a system administrator for McCown -Gordon. After her presentation, you&rsquo;ll have a couple of weeks to work on a response if you weren&rsquo;t able to attend in person. Lab 6, the quizzes are due this week and then Lab 6 is due next week. Lab 6 is kind of one of the big wrap -up labs where we talk about big things like file servers, mapping drives to those file servers, creating application servers, and building some working web applications. It&rsquo;s like three or four different things that we all do in different ways, but this uses all your VMs and your digital ocean droplets as well.</p><p>One thing that&rsquo;s coming up in this class is a final project. The final project is something that you get to propose, either building something or fixing something. The whole idea is you&rsquo;re not actually going to do the project, but instead what I want you to go through is the process of proposing it and scoping out the idea and then doing a SWOT analysis, which is strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of that idea. Then at the end you&rsquo;ll come to a conclusion whether it&rsquo;s a good idea or not. This is mostly a thought exercise. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be something that you can actually do, but it should be something that is realistic that you can accomplish using your skills. You can build a new network, you can fix a web app, you can develop a new web resource for a startup like a website or a store, you can set up laptops for a school or maybe even a lab at a school, you can design central authentication or a file server for a company, you can discuss using thin clients versus thick clients and labs, you can discuss using on -prem versus in -the -cloud computing, lots and lots of different things. Basically propose a scenario, give me the parameters of your scenario, are you working with a company, a school, your home, whatever, design the idea, do a SWOT analysis. It&rsquo;s very open -ended. It&rsquo;s really anything that you want to do, chat with me if you need help finding ideas. One part of the final project is you need to do some sort of a small demo for the project. Don&rsquo;t spend more than a couple hours on it. I really just want you to get your feet wet with a new idea or a new technology or something we haven&rsquo;t played around with yet as part of your final project.</p><p>So as we&rsquo;re working on stuff, don&rsquo;t forget to look at the GitHub Education Pack. You can go to DigitalOcean for a free trial offer. If you haven&rsquo;t done that yet for Lab 5, there&rsquo;s also Namecheap .me. If you need a domain name, anything like that. Otherwise, hopefully things are going well. Please feel free to keep in touch. We&rsquo;ve got discussions. We&rsquo;ve got office hours. Watch the deadlines on Canvas. The proposal for your final project is due December 1st. And then the actual final project is due December 15th. What you&rsquo;ll turn in for the final project is a 7 to 15 minute video of you discussing your project and you&rsquo;ll turn in your write -up. That&rsquo;s really all you have to do. It&rsquo;s pretty simple. You can record the video using Zoom or OBS or any other tool that you prefer. I would like to see you on camera as you talk through things. I think that&rsquo;s really important. But if you have any questions or concerns, let me know. Otherwise, we are nearing the end of the semester. We&rsquo;re on week 12 of 16, so hopefully things are going well. We&rsquo;ve just got a couple more weeks before Thanksgiving breaks. So keep up the good work, work warily hard on lab six, and let me know if you have any questions. Good luck.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div></div><script src=/cis527/js/clipboard.min.js?1729609743 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1729609743 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/theme.js?1729609743 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/tele-scroll.js?1729609743 defer></script></body></html>
