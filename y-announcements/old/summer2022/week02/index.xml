So this week you should be finishing up lab one. Lab one grading is due tonight by 7pm. So if you havenâ€™t scheduled a time to meet with me for grading, make sure you do that ASAP. I do have trainings on Monday afternoons from about one to three, I usually get done with those a little earlier.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week02/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
