So this week you should be working on lab 3. That’s really the only thing going on this week. So lab 3 deadline is this Friday. I did say last week it was due earlier in the week, but I’ve updated the deadline in Canvas to make sure everything matches. So lab 3 will be due this Friday. So make sure you schedule a time to meet with either Josh or I to get your lab 3 graded via Zoom before or on Friday of this week. Then we have a whole week where there’s nothing really due, but you should be working on lab 4. The quizzes for lab four are going to be due Monday, October 20th. And then Tuesday, October 21st, we’re going to have our third discussion prompt, and I’ll talk about that in just a second. And then Friday, 10/24, sorry, I didn’t get that date right. Lab 4 is going to be due. So all these dates are correct on Canvas. So when in doubt, check Canvas. It should always have the correct dates.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week07/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
