This assignment assumes you have completed all steps in Lab 5 successfully; if not, you should consult with the instructor to resolve any existing issues before continuing.</p><p>You will also need a Windows Server 2019 VM configured as an Active Directory Domain Controller, along with a Windows 10 VM added as a client computer on that domain. In general, you may continue to use the resources created in Lab 4, but you may choose to recreate them as directed in Lab 4 if desired.</p><p>In addition, you will need two Ubuntu VMs, one labelled <strong>SERVER</strong> and the other labelled <strong>CLIENT</strong>.
