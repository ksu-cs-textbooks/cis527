      <description>Resources Slides Video Transcript Welcome to Module 4! In this module, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to use directory services to provide consistent user accounts and permissions across a number of systems. Specifically, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the Active Directory Domain Services for Windows, and the OpenLDAP implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for Ubuntu Linux.
In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to configure clients to connect to each of those servers.</description>

      <description>Lab 4 - Directory Services Instructions Create four virtual machines meeting the specifications given below. The best way to accomplish this is to treat this assignment like a checklist and check things off as you complete them.
If you have any questions about these items or are unsure what they mean, please contact the instructor. Remember that part of being a system administrator (and a software developer in general) is working within vague specifications to provide what your client is requesting, so eliciting additional information is a very necessary skill.</description>

      <description>Resources Join Windows 10 PC to a Domain from Windows 10 Forums Video Transcript Once you have completely set up your Active Directory Domain, you can begin to add Windows clients to the domain. This video will walk through some of that process, and I&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a few of the steps as we go.
For this example, I have my Windows 10 VM from the earlier labs. It is on the same network as the domain controller.</description>

      <description>Resources SSSD on Ubuntu Server Guide (look for the LDAP section) Video Transcript Once we&amp;rsquo;ve set up and configured our OpenLDAP server on Linux, we can configure another VM to act as an LDAP client and use that server for authentication. Thankfully, now that Ubuntu 20.04 uses SSSD, this process is pretty simple.
For the most part, we&amp;rsquo;ll be following the instructions in the Ubuntu Server Guide page linked below this video.</description>

In many organizations today, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a mix of many different operating systems, so it is very helpful to understand how to integrate them together in a single directory service.</description>

      <description>It appears that I have managed to confuse lots of people with the Windows AD portion of this lab. That&amp;rsquo;s not my intent, and any confusion is totally my fault here. This is mostly due to the fact that I reused an older video showing how to set up an Active Directory server and not clearly describing how things should be changed. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to clarify what you need to know and how you can adapt any existing setup you may have so that it works.</description>

      <title>Lab 4 Networking Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis527/4-directory-services/12-lab4-networking/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://ksu-cs-textbooks.github.io/cis527/4-directory-services/12-lab4-networking/index.html</guid>
      <description>Here are some helpful networking diagrams to better explain the desired state before and after the end of Lab 4. In all of these diagrams, I am using a sample network with the IP address 192.168.40.0. You will have to adapt the IPs to match your network configuration. In addition, each network address will need to be updated with your unique eID as directed in the lab assignment.
After Lab 3 Once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed all of Lab 3, your network diagram should resemble the one shown above.</description>
