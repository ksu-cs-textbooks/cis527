So you should be starting on lab six this week. Lab six is going to be due next week on Friday. We&rsquo;re also going to have our fourth discussion session next week on Wednesday. So our next discussion speaker is Sarah Allen. Sarah Allen is a computer support person for McCon Gordon construction. Sarah was a student in this class a few years ago and now works in industry as a frontline support tech. She has a lot of good experience and stories to tell from working in that industry. So she&rsquo;s going to come in and be our guest speaker this Wednesday, November 13th. So a week from this Wednesday at 2 30 p .m. So make sure you put that on your calendar. The questions post is already up so you can get questions asked for Sarah. I&rsquo;ve also linked her LinkedIn so you can learn a little bit more about her background and what she does.</p><p>So for lab six that you&rsquo;re working on, we&rsquo;re going to do a whole bunch of different things. This is kind of where we break out a little bit. We&rsquo;re going to explore file servers on both Windows and Linux using your local VMs for the most part. If you&rsquo;re working in Azure, you&rsquo;ll do your file server on the Windows server in Azure. We&rsquo;re also going to work on drive mappings between the two so you can connect to those file servers. We&rsquo;re going to build an application server on Windows. We&rsquo;re going to do that on the Windows server by installing a web application. And then on Linux, we&rsquo;re going to do that in the cloud using our Digital Ocean Droplets to build some working web apps there.</p><p>So don&rsquo;t forget the other thing in this class is there is a final project in this class. It is worth 10 percent of the grade. The proposal for your final project is due the Friday before Thanksgiving, so I can review those and get those back to you pretty quickly. The idea, remember, behind the final project is to do a proposal and a SWOT analysis. The proposal is to build something or fix something I .T. related. It could be a web resource for a startup like how would you build a website with high availability and failover modes? How would you automatically set up laptops for school? How would you define a central authentication system for a company using Active Directory or LDAP? Discussing the pros and cons of thin clients versus thick clients in computer labs, lots of different things you can do. to remember this is mostly a thought exercise where you get to set the framing and then you get to do the analysis, but you&rsquo;ll also have a small proof of concept of your project that&rsquo;s something related. If you&rsquo;re not sure what to do, feel free to chat with me for ideas. I&rsquo;m always happy to work with you and kind of help you find some ideas or final projects that might work for you.</p><p>So that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got this week. Hopefully if you&rsquo;re on campus, you&rsquo;re looking at either volunteering for the high school programming contest, which is tomorrow, or participating in Hack case eight, which is this weekend, albeit both events. So other than that, keep in touch on Discord or come to Tea Time Office Hours or chat with me on Ed discussion. We&rsquo;d be happy to work with you if you have any questions, but that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;ve got this week. So good luck and I will see you again next week.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>8.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
