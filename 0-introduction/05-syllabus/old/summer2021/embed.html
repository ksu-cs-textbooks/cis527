There may be some bumps in the road. Students will work at their own pace through several modules, with due dates for completion of each module given. Material will be provided in the form of recorded videos, links to online resources, and discussion prompts. Each module will include a hands-on lab assignment, which will be graded interactively by the instructor or GTAs. Assignments may also include written portions or presentations, which will be submitted online.</p><p>The course will also include a final project and presentation. More information about this can be found in the final project module on Canvas.</p><h3 id=course-description>Course Description</h3><p>Computer information systems form the backbone of many large organizations, and many students will be called upon in their careers to help create, manage and maintain these large systems. This course will give students knowledge and experience working with enterprise level computer systems including workstation management, file servers, web servers, networking devices, configuration management, monitoring, and more. We will mainly focus on the GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows server software, and much of the learning will take place in hands-on lab activities working directly with these systems. In addition, students will be responsible for developing some technical documentation and communicating information about their systems in a variety of ways. Finally, throughout the course students will be exposed to a variety of information directly from system administrators across campus.</p><h3 id=student-learning-outcomes>Student Learning Outcomes</h3><p>After completing this course, a successful student will be able to:</p><ul><li>Understand the major components of an enterprise level computer network and server system</li><li>Design and implement a simple enterprise level server system and network, as well as provision workstations on that network quickly and easily</li><li>Communicate information about enterprise systems clearly and effectively to users of all skill levels and interests</li><li>Develop ways to increase efficiency by automating tasks whenever possible using scripting and configuration management tools</li><li>Understand and describe security risks in any enterprise system and any ways that they can be mitigated</li><li>Show how to monitor enterprise systems for problems and use that information to locate and fix any issues within the system</li><li>Work with cloud technologies and describe how they can be integrated into an enterprise information technology setup</li></ul><h3 id=major-course-topics>Major Course Topics</h3><ul><li>Configuration Management using Puppet</li><li>Creating Secure Workstations (CIS 225 overview/review)</li><li>Setting up an Enterprise Directory Service & Single Sign On</li><li>Enterprise File Sharing</li><li>Web & Application Servers</li><li>Core Networking Services (DHCP, DNS, ICMP, etc.)</li><li>System Monitoring & Maintenance</li><li>Backup Strategies</li><li>The Cloud & DevOps</li></ul><h3 id=the-work>The Work</h3><p>There is no shortcut to becoming a great programmer or system administrator. Only by <strong>doing the work</strong> will you develop the skills and knowledge to make you a successful system administrator. This course is built around that principle, and gives you ample opportunity to do the work, with as much support as we can offer.</p><p><strong>Lectures & Quizzes:</strong> Each module will include many lectures and quizzes. The goal is to introduce you to a new topic and provide ample background information, then check for your understanding of the core concepts through the quiz. Many lectures include links to additional resources that you are welcome to review if you want to dig deeper into a particular topic. Those additional resources may also be useful when completing the lab assignments.</p><p><strong>Lab Assignments:</strong> Throughout the semester you will be building a non-trivial system architecture iteratively; every week a new lab assignment will be due. Each lab builds upon the prior lab&rsquo;s infrastructure, so it is critical that you complete each lab in a timely manner! This process also reflects the way system administration is done in the real world - breaking large projects into more readily achievable milestones helps manage the development process.</p><p>Following along that real-world theme, labs will mostly be graded on whether they achieve the goals as described in the lab assignment. You can think of each lab assignment as a directive given to you by your supervisor - if you meet those requirements, you are successful; however, if your system fails to meet those requirements, then it is not useful at all, even if it is partially complete. In practice, you may earn some partial credit for attempting a portion of a lab, but the majority of points will require full functionality.</p><p><strong>Final Project:</strong> At the end of this course, you will design and evaluate a final project of your choosing to demonstrate your ability. This project can link back to your interest or other fields, and will serve as a capstone project for this course.</p><h3 id=grading>Grading</h3><p>In theory, each student begins the course with an A. As you submit work, you can either maintain your A (for good work) or chip away at it (for less adequate or incomplete work). In practice, each student starts with 0 points in the gradebook and works upward toward a final point total earned out of the possible number of points. In this course, each assignment constitutes a portion of the final grade, as detailed below:</p><ul><li>70% - Lab Assignments* (7 labs, 10% each lab)</li><li>10% - Quizzes (15 quizzes, 0.66% each)</li><li>10% - Discussions (5 discussions, 2% each)</li><li>10% - Final Project</li></ul><p>All group work will include a <strong>REQUIRED</strong> peer evaluation component which can adjust that portion of the individual’s grade up to 50%. If a student should fail to contribute to a group assignment at all, their grade for that assignment will be reduced to a zero. Failure to complete the peer evaluation will result in a 10% grade deduction for that assignment.</p><p>Letter grades will be assigned following the standard scale:</p><ul><li>90% - 100% → A</li><li>80% - 89.99% → B</li><li>70% - 79.99% → C</li><li>60% - 69.99% → D</li><li>00% - 59.99% → F</li></ul><h3 id=late-work>Late Work</h3><div class="box notices cstyle warning"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Warning</div><div class=box-content><p>While my original intent was to have this course completely asynchronous and self-paced, I&rsquo;ve found that students prefer having more strict deadlines than more flexibility, and many times they will perform better in the course when deadlines are enforced. Therefore, deadlines will be strictly enforced this semester. Read this late work policy very carefully! If you are unsure how to interpret it, please contact the instructors via email. Not understanding the policy does not mean that it won&rsquo;t apply to you!</p></div></div><p>Due to the asynchronous nature of this course, staying on task and keeping up with deadlines is very important. Therefore, all course work must be submitted, and all interactively graded materials must be graded with the instructor or GTA, on or before the posted due date to receive full credit. <em>For labs, it is not simply enough to contact the instructor/GTA asking to schedule a grading time before the due date; the grading itself must be completed before the due date in order to be considered &ldquo;on time&rdquo;.</em></p><p>Any work submitted and graded after the due date is subject to a deduction of <strong>10% of the total points possible on the assignment for each class day</strong> that the assignment is late. For example, if an assignment is due on a Friday and is submitted the following Tuesday, it will be subject to a reduction of 20% of the total points possible, or 10% for each class day it was late (Monday and Tuesday in this example). Grading done on non-class days will be considered to have been submitted on the next available class day. <em>Deductions for non-class days will still be automatically entered by Canvas - contact the instructor to have these deductions removed.</em></p><p><strong>These deductions will only be applied to grades above 60%</strong> of the total points on the assignment. So, if you scored higher than 60%, your grade will be reduced by the late penalty down to a minimum grade of 60%. If you scored lower than 60% on the assignment, no deductions will be applied.</p><p>Also, note that several labs in this class require successful completion of previous labs. If you are behind and choose to skip a lab assignment to catch up, you may still have to make up some or all of that work in order to complete a later lab. You may contact the instructor to discuss options for obtaining model solutions to previous labs if needed.</p><p>All course work must be submitted, and all interactively graded materials must be graded with the instructor, on or before the last day of the semester in which the student is enrolled in the course in order for it to be graded on time. No late work will be accepted after that date.</p><p>If you have extenuating circumstances, please discuss them with the instructor as soon as they arise so other arrangements can be made. If you know you have upcoming events that will prevent you from completing work in this course, you should contact the instructor ASAP and plan on working ahead before your event instead of catching up afterwards. If you find that you are getting behind in the class, you are encouraged to speak to the instructor for options to catch up quickly.</p><h3 id=recommended-texts--supplies>Recommended Texts & Supplies</h3><p>The online textbook for this course can be found at <a href=https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/ rel=external target=_blank>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/</a>. All relevant pages from the textbook are also embedded into the appropriate Canvas modules.</p><p>Students in this course are expected to have access to a computer with virtual machine software (VMware, Virtual Box, Parallels, or other) installed and running. The computer should be capable of running multiple VMs simultaneously, which usually means having 8GB of RAM and a moderately powerful processor. Contact the instructor if you have questions or concerns.</p><p>All K-State Computer Science students have access to free software from Microsoft and VMWare. More information can be found on the <a href=https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/Main_Page rel=external target=_blank>K-State CS Support Website</a>.</p><p>Since this class covers such a wide range of material, no single textbook will suffice. Therefore, students who would like a textbook should refer to resources available on Safari Books Online. The <a href="http://guides.lib.k-state.edu/az.php?q=Safari" rel=external target=_blank>K-State Library</a> has access to the entire catalog of books published on that platform, and it is a great resource for this course.</p><p>We will also use several online resources as needed.</p><p>This book contains useful information for anyone thinking about pursuing a career in system administration or information technology in general:</p><p><strong>&ldquo;The Practice of System and Network Administration&rdquo;</strong> by Thomas Limoncelli, Christina Hogan and Strata Chalup.<br>ISBN 0321492668 - eBook Editions Available - <a href=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321492668 rel=external target=_blank>Amazon Link</a></p><h3 id=subject-to-change>Subject to Change</h3><p>The details in this syllabus are not set in stone. Due to the flexible nature of this class, adjustments may need to be made as the semester progresses, though they will be kept to a minimum. If any changes occur, the changes will be posted on the K-State Canvas page for this course and emailed to all students.</p><h3 id=academic-honesty>Academic Honesty</h3><p>Kansas State University has an Honor and Integrity System based on personal integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one&rsquo;s work is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor and Integrity System. The policies and procedures of the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/honor/ rel=external target=_blank>Honor and Integrity System</a> apply to all full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. A component vital to the Honor and Integrity System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: &ldquo;On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.&rdquo; A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.</p><p><strong>For this course, a violation of the Honor Pledge will result in sanctions such as a 0 on the assignment or an XF in the course, depending on severity. Actively seeking unauthorized aid, such as posting lab assignments on sites such as Chegg or StackOverflow or asking another person to complete your work, even if unsuccessful, will result in an immediate XF in the course.</strong></p><h3 id=students-with-disabilities>Students with Disabilities</h3><p>Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor. Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at <a href=mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu rel=external target=_blank>accesscenter@k-state.edu</a>, 785-532-6441; for K-State Polytechnic campus, contact Julie Rowe, Diversity, Inclusion and Access Coordinator, at <a href=mailto:jarowe@ksu.edu rel=external target=_blank>jarowe@ksu.edu</a> or call 785-826-2971.</p><h3 id=expectations-for-conduct>Expectations for Conduct</h3><p>All student activities in the University, including this course, are governed by the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/sga/judicial/ rel=external target=_blank>Student Judicial Conduct Code</a> as outlined in the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/sga/old_files/sgadocs/ByLaws.pdf rel=external target=_blank>Student Governing Association By Laws</a>, Article V, Section 3, number 2. Students who engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be asked to leave the class.</p><h3 id=diversity-and-inclusion>Diversity and Inclusion</h3><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>This is my personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from <a href=https://tomprof.stanford.edu/posting/1625 rel=external target=_blank>this statement</a> created by two educators at Brown University. I feel that a statement such as this is very powerful and important in today&rsquo;s world, and I&rsquo;ll do my best to live up to it. &ndash;Russ</p></div></div><p>In an ideal world, science and technology would be objective. However, much of science and technology is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices. In this class, we will reference many materials from a diverse set of sources, but limits still exist on this diversity. I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a technical nature.</p><p>Please contact me or submit anonymous feedback through the Computer Science department office if you have any concerns or suggestions regarding this course and related materials.</p><p>Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:</p><ul><li>If you have a name and/or use pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official K-State records, please let me know!</li><li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li><li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your academic advisor or the staff in the College of Engineering Student Services office are excellent resources. They are able to also share this information with me anonymously, or keep it confidential.</li></ul><p>I, like many people, am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class, by anyone, that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.</p><h3 id=netiquette>Netiquette</h3><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>This is my personal policy and not a required syllabus statement from K-State. It has been adapted from <a href=https://global.k-state.edu/students/courses/netiquette/ rel=external target=_blank>this statement</a> from K-State Global Campus, and the <a href=https://www.recurse.com/manual rel=external target=_blank>Recurse Center Manual</a>. I have adapted their ideas to fit this course. &ndash;Russ</p></div></div><p>Online communication is inherently different than in-person communication. When speaking in person, many times we can take advantage of the <em>context</em> and <em>body language</em> of the person speaking to better understand what the speaker <em>means</em>, not just what is said. This information is not present when communicating online, so we must be much more careful about what we say and how we say it in order to get our meaning across.</p><p>Here are a few general rules to help us all communicate online in this course, especially while using tools such as Canvas or Discord:</p><ul><li><strong>Use a clear and meaningful subject line to announce your topic.</strong> Subject lines such as &ldquo;Question&rdquo; or &ldquo;Problem&rdquo; are not helpful. Subjects such as &ldquo;Logic Question in Project 5, Part 1 in Java&rdquo; or &ldquo;Unexpected Exception when Opening Text File in Python&rdquo; give plenty of information about your topic.</li><li><strong>Use only one topic per message.</strong> If you have multiple topics, post multiple messages so each one can be discussed independently.</li><li><strong>Be thorough, concise, and to the point.</strong> Ideally, each message should be a page or less.</li><li><strong>Include exact error messages, code snippets, or screenshots, as well as any previous steps taken to fix the problem.</strong> It is much easier to solve a problem when the exact error message or screenshot is provided. If we know what you&rsquo;ve tried so far, we can get to the root cause of the issue more quickly.</li><li><strong>Consider carefully what you write before you post it.</strong> Once a message is posted, it becomes part of the permanent record of the course and can easily be found by others.</li><li><strong>If you are lost, don&rsquo;t know an answer, or don&rsquo;t understand something, speak up!</strong> Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask questions anytime.</li><li><strong>Class discussions are confidential.</strong> Do not share information from the course with anyone outside of the course without explicit permission.</li><li><strong>Do not quote entire message chains; only include the relevant parts.</strong> When replying to a previous message, only quote the relevant lines in your response.</li><li><strong>Do not use all caps.</strong> It makes it look like you are shouting. Use appropriate text markup (bold, italics, etc.) to highlight a point if needed.</li><li><strong>No feigning surprise.</strong> If someone asks a question, saying things like &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe you don&rsquo;t know that!&rdquo; are not helpful, and only serve to make that person feel bad.</li><li><strong>No &ldquo;well-actually&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</strong> If someone makes a statement that is not entirely correct, resist the urge to offer a &ldquo;well, actually&mldr;&rdquo; correction, especially if it is not relevant to the discussion. If you can help solve their problem, feel free to provide correct information, but don&rsquo;t post a correction just for the sake of being correct.</li><li><strong>Do not correct someone&rsquo;s grammar or spelling.</strong> Again, it is not helpful, and only serves to make that person feel bad.</li><li><strong>Avoid subtle -isms and microaggressions.</strong> Avoid comments that could make others feel uncomfortable based on their personal identity. See the syllabus section on Diversity and Inclusion above for more information on this topic. If a comment makes you uncomfortable, please contact the instructor.</li><li><strong>Avoid sarcasm, flaming, advertisements, lingo, trolling, doxxing, and other bad online habits.</strong> They have no place in an academic environment. Tasteful humor is fine, but sarcasm can be misunderstood.</li></ul><p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates by adhering to the <a href=https://www.k-state.edu/about/values/community/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State Principles of Community</a>.</p><h3 id=face-coverings>Face Coverings</h3><p>To protect the health and safety of the K-State community, students, faculty, staff and visitors must wear face coverings over their mouths and noses in all indoor and outdoor spaces while you are on university property unless you are alone in a private office or workspace or alone outdoors. In addition, all new students are required to complete <a href=https://kstate.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eJ6LHbFIJ8GFD7f rel=external target=_blank>face covering training</a> that also covers COVID-19 transmission, risk mitigation and the Every Wildcat a Wellcat pledge. Students needing accommodations may contact the Student Access Center at <a href=mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu rel=external target=_blank>accesscenter@k-state.edu</a>.</p><p>In classrooms, faculty have the right to deny a student entry into the room if the student is not wearing a face covering. Students not wearing a face covering will be reminded to do so and offered a clean face covering, if one is available. If the student does not comply, the faculty member will ask the student to leave the space, and if available, join the class remotely. As a last resort, campus police will be called.

Although new ideas or research results may be controversial or challenge established views, the health and growth of any society requires frank intellectual exchange. Academic freedom protects this type of free exchange and is thus essential to any university&rsquo;s mission.</p><p>Moreover, academic freedom supports collaborative work in the pursuit of truth and the dissemination of knowledge in an environment of inquiry, respectful debate, and professionalism. Academic freedom is not limited to the classroom or to scientific and scholarly research, but extends to the life of the university as well as to larger social and political questions. It is the right and responsibility of the university community to engage with such issues.</p><h3 id=campus-safety>Campus Safety</h3><p>Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.
