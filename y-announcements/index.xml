My name is Russell Feldhausen. I’ll be your instructor for this semester. My contact information is here on the screen. You can also find it on the Canvas homepage, on the syllabus, just about anywhere you look with this class. You can find my contact info. My email is here. My website is here. You can also find me on Teams and Discord as at russfeld. I’m pretty easy to get a hold of. One thing to be aware of, I do work remotely. I live in Kansas City, and so I’m working remotely Tuesdays through Fridays. I am on campus on Mondays. So if you want to see me in person, you can meet with me on Mondays. Usually Monday mornings is when I’m going to be available. And there is a way to schedule that that I’ll talk about here in just a minute. But just be aware of that. The rest of the week, I work remotely, which does mean I’m pretty easy to get a hold of on Teams or Discord or Ed Discussion anytime you have a question.</description></item></channel></rss>
