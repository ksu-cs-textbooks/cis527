So, this week today, we’re hosting our first discussion session just shortly after this video gets posted. So, make sure you get the questions in for that. Tomorrow is when the lab three quizzes are going to be due. And then you’ve got until next week to work on lab three. I’m not saying Tuesday, but lab three, I believe, is actually due next Wednesday. But the second discussion will be next Tuesday, so make sure you’re watching out for that.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week06/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
