Our board has recently been discussing the topic of stewardship, and we spent quite a bit of time discussing what the word stewardship actually means. As it turns out, that word can have many connotations and different meanings for different people.

For me, good stewardship is about caring for the church and the larger community, making sure they both have the resources needed to do the good work and be the change that we all wish to see in the world. Many of us choose to support that mission by making donations of our time, our talents, and our treasure. We give away some of our limited resources, in the hopes that all those little gifts can combine together to become something greater

As we hopefully start to leave the world of the pandemic behind and look ahead toward our new normal, we should all take a moment to stop and reflect about what we want that new normal to be, and how we can achieve it. The answer may be different for all of us, and that's fine. That's the beauty of all of this - we can each individually assess our available resources and desired outcomes, and determine what would be the best option for us. You may have time to help cook and serve meals to those who need it, you may have the talent to help build a website or create a beautiful garden for everyone to dwell in peace with nature, or you may have treasure beyond your needs, and choose to give some of that money to support the causes that matter most to you.

Today, I ask you to think about the world as you wish it could be, and what resources you have that could be given in support of that vision. Your support, of both your time, your talents, and your treasure, are all crucial toward the work of our UU communities building a better world. As we gather together this summer and share in these cooperative services, we have a chance to give back to the churches who invite us into their services, and I encourage you to do so. The offering will now be given, and gratefully received.
