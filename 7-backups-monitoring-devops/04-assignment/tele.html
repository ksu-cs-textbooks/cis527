This assignment assumes you have completed all steps in the previous labs successfully; if not, you should consult with the instructor to resolve any existing issues before continuing.</p><p>You will also need a Windows Server 2019 VM configured as an Active Directory Domain Controller, along with a Windows 10 VM added as a client computer on that domain. You should continue to use the systems from Lab 6.</p><p>Finally, you will need two Ubuntu 20.04 VMs, but they don&rsquo;t need any particular configuration beyond what is specified in Lab 1 or Lab 2. You may continue to use your Ubuntu VMs from Lab 6.</p><hr><h3 id=task-1-backup--restore-windows-active-directory>Task 1: Backup & Restore Windows Active Directory</h3><p>This task requires you to successfully demonstrate a backup and restore procedure for your Windows Server 2016 Active Directory domain. To complete this item, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Create a user named <code>backupuser</code> on your Active Directory domain</li><li>Create a group named <code>BackupGroup</code> on your Active Directory domain, and add the new <code>backupuser</code> user to that group</li><li>Log on to your Windows 10 client VM as <code>backupuser</code> and take a <strong>screenshot</strong> showing the successful login and the system time of your host system.</li><li>Create a backup of your Active Directory domain using the Windows System State backup tool. You should store this backup on an external hard disk, such as a flash drive, that is mounted in your Windows Server 2019 VM. Alternatively, you may add a secondary hard disk to your Windows Server 2019 VM and use that location to store the backup. See the video in the resources section for instructions.</li><li>Once the backup is complete, delete the <code>backupuser</code> user and <code>BackupGroup</code> group from the Active Directory domain.</li><li>Reboot your Windows 10 client VM and attempt to log on as <code>backupuser</code>. It should fail. Take a <strong>screenshot</strong> showing a failed login and the system time of your host system</li><li>Perform an authoritative restore of the Active Directory domain from the backup. This should restore the deleted user and group. Take a <strong>screenshot</strong> showing the successful completion of the authoritative restore process and the system time of your host system.</li></ol><div class="box notices cstyle info"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-info-circle"></i> Info</div><div class=box-content><p><em>The documentation for this portion is unclear. In my testing, you may be able to just checkmark the &ldquo;Perform an authoritative restore of Active Directory files&rdquo; option when restoring the backup and avoid any command-line work. That seems to be working correctly as of Summer 2021. However, if that doesn&rsquo;t work or you choose to do the authoritative restore via command-line, you need to get the path correct. To help with that, here&rsquo;s a hint: for my sample domain <code>ad.russfeld.cis527.cs.ksu.edu</code> and account <code>backupuser</code>, I&rsquo;ll need to use the command <code>restore object "cn=backupuser,cn=Users,dc=ad,dc=russfeld,dc=cis527,dc=cs,dc=ksu,dc=edu"</code> to restore the correct account on the domain. &ndash;Russ</em></p></div></div><ol start=8><li>Reboot your Windows 10 client VM and log on to that system as <code>backupuser</code>.

It should contain enough information to recreate the database schema and all data.</li><li>Clear, concise instructions in a README file for restoring this backup on a new environment. Assume the systems in that new environment are configured as directed in Lab 5. These instructions would be used by yourself or a system administrator of similar skill and experience to restore this application - that is, you don&rsquo;t have to pedantically spell out how to perform every step, but you should provide enough information to easily reinstall the application and restore the backup with a minimum of effort and research.</li></ol><h4 id=resources-1>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=https://www.howtogeek.com/248780/how-to-compress-and-extract-files-using-the-tar-command-on-linux/ rel=external target=_blank>How to Compress and Extract Files using the tar Command on Linux</a> from How-To Geek</li><li><a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-import-and-export-databases-and-reset-a-root-password-in-mysql rel=external target=_blank>How to Import and Export Databases and Reset a Root Password in MySQL</a> from DigitalOcean</li><li><a href=https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-backup-mysql-databases-on-an-ubuntu-vps rel=external target=_blank>How To Backup MySQL Databases on an Ubuntu VPS</a> from DigitalOcean (steps should still be valid for 20.04)</li></ul><hr><h3 id=task-3-ubuntu-monitoring-part-1>Task 3: Ubuntu Monitoring Part 1</h3><p>For this task, you will set up Checkmk to monitor your server</p><ol><li>Configure the Ubuntu droplet named <strong>FRONTEND</strong> as the primary host for Checkmk.</li><li>Then, add the <strong>FRONTEND</strong> and <strong>BACKEND</strong> droplets as two monitored hosts</li><li>Send the URL of the Checkmk dashboard and the password in your grading packet.
