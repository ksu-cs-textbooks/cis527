This information is very helpful in understanding the larger role that many of these services play in modern computer networks.</p><p>At its core, a directory service is simply a piece of software that can store and retrieve information. The information stored could take many forms, including user accounts, groups, system information, resources, security settings, and more. By providing a centralized location to store that information, it becomes much simpler to share that information across a large enterprise network.</p><p>We&rsquo;ve already worked with one example of a directory service in this course. The modern Domain Name Service is, at its core, a directory service. It stores a directory of domain names matched to IP addresses, as well as additional information about a domain such as the location of the mail server. It can then provide that information to the systems on a large network, providing a level of consistency that is difficult to achieve if each computer has to store a local version of the same information.</p><p>Directory services for computers have also been around for quite a while. This page gives a brief timeline of events, starting in the late 1980s and culminating with the release of Microsoft&rsquo;s Active Directory Domain Services in 1999. Let&rsquo;s look at each of these items in detail.</p><p>First, the X.500 set of standards was released in 1988, and was one of the first projects that aimed to provide a consistent directory of user account information. It was actually developed as a directory for the X.400 set of standards for email, which at that time was the dominant way that email was handled on the internet. Those standards were developed using the OSI networking protocols. However, with the rise of the TCP/IP set of internet protocols, these systems were quickly made obsolete. X.400 was replaced by the SMTP standards used today to send email between MTAs, while X.500 forms the basis of many later protocols. What is most notable about X.500 is that it actually defined several underlying protocols, including a Directory Access Protocol (DAP), as well as a Directory System Protocol (DSP) and others. Today, we primarily use protocols based on the original DAP defined by X.500.</p><p>Soon after the release of the X.500 standards, work began on an implementation of the DAP protocol using the TCP/IP internet protocols. It was eventually named the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, or LDAP. LDAP is the underlying protocol used by many of todays directory services, including Microsoft Active Directory.</p><p>However, it is very important to understand that LDAP is not a complete implementation of the original X.500 DAP. Instead, it implements a core set of features, and then adds some additional features not present in the original protocol, while several parts of the original protocol are not implemented. The maintainers of the X.500 standard are very quick to point out this difference, but in practice most systems fully support LDAP as it stands today.</p><p>LDAP also has uses beyond just a directory service for user accounts on workstations. For example, LDAP can be used to provide a user lookup service to an email client, or it can be linked with a website to provide user authentication from a central repository of users.</p><p>LDAP, along with many other directory services, defines a tree structure for the data. In this way, the data can be organized in a hierarchical manner, closely resembling the real relationships between people, departments, and organizations in an enterprise. For example, in this diagram, you can clearly see nodes in the tree for the overarching organization, the organizational unit, and the individual user.</p><p>LDAP uses several short abbreviations for different fields and types of data, and at times they can be a bit confusing to new system administrators. This slide lists a few of the most common ones, as well as a good way to remember them. For example, an <code>ou</code> in LDAP is an organizational unit, which could be a department, office, or some other collection of users and systems.</p><p>You can see these abbreviations clearly in this sample LDAP entry. Here, we can see the distinguished name includes the canonical name, as well as the domain components identifying its location in the tree. We can also see the common name and surname for this user, as well as the distinguished name for his supervisor. As you work with LDAP throughout this module, you&rsquo;ll see data presented in this format several times.</p><p>Switching gears a bit, in the early 1990s, there were many different software programs developed to help share files and users between systems. One of the first was Samba. Samba is an open source project that originally reverse engineered the SMB (hence the name) and CIFS file sharing protocols used by Windows. By doing so, they were able to enable file sharing between Linux based systems, including Macs, and Windows. Eventually, Microsoft worked with the developers of the project to allow them to fully implement the protocol, and in more recent versions, a computer running Samba can even act as part of an Active Directory domain. We&rsquo;ll work with Samba a bit later this semester when we deal with application servers.</p><p>Around the same time, Novell released their Directory Services software. This was one of the first directory services targeted at large organizations, and for many years it was the dominant software in that area. It was built on top of the IPX/SPX internet protocols, so it required computers to run special software in order to use the directory service.</p><p>Much like the LDAP example earlier, NDS also supported a tree structure for storing information in the directory. It also had some novel features for assigning permissions across different users and <code>ou</code>s, which made it a very powerful tool. Many older system administrators have probably worked with Novell in the past. I remember that both my high school, as well as some departments at K-State, used NDS until they switched to Microsoft Active Directory in the mid 2000s.</p><p>Before we discuss Active Directory, we should first discuss Windows Workgroups and Homegroups. Most home networks don&rsquo;t need a full directory service, but it is very helpful to have a way to share files easily between a few computers connected to the same network. Prior to Windows 7, Windows used a &ldquo;Workgroup&rdquo; to share these files.</p><p>Computers with the same Workgroup name would be able to discover each other across a local network, and any shared files or resources would be available. However, user accounts were not shared, so you wanted to access a resource shared from a particular computer, you&rsquo;d have to know a username and password for that system as well. For smaller networks, this usually wasn&rsquo;t a problem at all. However, as the network grows larger, it becomes more and more difficult to maintain consistent user accounts across all systems.</p><p>That all changed in 1999 with the introduction of Microsoft Active Directory. It coincided with the release of Windows 2000, one of the first major Windows releases directly targeted at large enterprises. Active Directory uses LDAP and Kerberos to handle authentication, and provides not only a central repository of user accounts and systems, but it can also be used to share security configurations across those systems as well. It was really ideal for large enterprise networks, and gave administrators the level of control they desired. Active Directory quickly became the dominant directory service, and most enterprises today use Active Directory to manage user accounts for their Windows systems. In fact, both K-State and K-State Computer Science primarily use Active Directory to manage their user accounts across a variety of systems and platforms.</p><p>With a shared domain, the user account information is stored on the central domain controller, instead of the individual workstations. In this way, any user who has a valid account on the domain and permissions to access a resource can do so, regardless of which system they are connected to. This is what allows you to use the same user account to log on to computers across campus, as well as online resources such as webmail and Canvas. One of the major activities in this lab will be to install and configure an Active Directory Domain, so you can get first-hand experience of how this works.</p><p>Lastly, no discussion of directory services would be complete without discussing Kerberos. Kerberos is named after Cerberus, the three-headed dog from ancient Greek mythology. It allows a client and a server to mutually authenticate each other&rsquo;s identity through a third party, hence the three-headed mascot.</p><p>Kerberos was originally developed at MIT in the 1980s, and fully released in 1993 as RFC 1510. It is one of the primary ways that directory services today handle authentication, and it is used by many other types of security software on the internet today.</p><p>The Kerberos protocol is quite complex, and it uses many different cryptographic primitives to ensure the communication is properly secured and authenticated. However, this diagram gives a quick overview of the protocol and how it works.</p><ol><li>First, the client will communicate with the authentication server.</li><li>The server responds with two messages, labelled A and B in this diagram. Message A is encrypted by the server using the client&rsquo;s key. When the client receives that message, it attempts to decrypt it. If it is successful, it can use the contents inside the message to prove its identity.</li><li>Then, it can send two new messages, C and D, to the ticket granting server, which in practice is usually the authentication server, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be. Message C includes the contents of message B along with information about what the client would like to access, and message D is the decrypted contents of the original message A. The ticket granting server then looks at those messages and confirms the user&rsquo;s identity.</li><li>If it is correct, it will then send two more messages, E and F, to the client. Message E is the ticket that can be given to the server containing the desired resource, and message F contains a key that can be used to communicate with that server.</li><li>So, the client finally can contact the destination server, sending along message E, the ticket from earlier, as well as a new message G that is protected with the key contained in message F.</li><li>Finally, the server decrypts message G and uses it to create and send back message H, which can be confirmed by the client to make sure the server is using the same key.</li></ol><p>If everything works correctly, both the client and server know they can trust each other, and they have established keys that allow them to communicate privately and share the requested information. Kerberos is a very powerful protocol, and if you&rsquo;d like to learn more, I highly recommend reading the linked resources below this video. Kerberos is also discussed in several of the cybersecurity courses here at K-State.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all the background information you&rsquo;ll need for this module. Next, you&rsquo;ll work on installing Microsoft Active Directory on Windows and OpenLDAP on Ubuntu, as well as configuring clients to use those systems for authentication.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=assignment>Assignment</h1><h3 id=lab-4---directory-services>Lab 4 - Directory Services</h3><h4 id=instructions>Instructions</h4><p>Create <strong>four</strong> virtual machines meeting the specifications given below.

You may also choose instead to disable them and reconfigure the VMware NAT network to handle DHCP duties.

The goal of this video isn&rsquo;t to show you all the steps of the process, but provide commentary on some of the more confusing steps you&rsquo;ll perform.</p><p>In general, I&rsquo;ll be following the two guides linked in the resources section below this video. The third guide gives quite a bit of additional information about each option in the Active Directory Domain Services installation wizard, and is a very handy reference as you work through this process.</p><p>First, I&rsquo;ll need to set a static IP address on this system. I&rsquo;ll be using the IP address ending in <code>42</code> for this server, which was reserved in in the DNS server configured in Lab 3. I&rsquo;ll also need to configure some static DNS entries. For a Domain Controller, you&rsquo;ll always want to make the first DNS entry the IP address of the server itself. This is because a Domain Controller also acts as a DNS server for the domain, so you&rsquo;ll need to tell this system to refer to itself for some DNS lookups. For the other entry, I&rsquo;ll use the VMware router, which is the same as the default gateway address in my setup.</p><p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to follow the steps to add the &ldquo;Active Directory Domain Services&rdquo; role to this server. This process is pretty straightforward, so I&rsquo;ll leave it to you to follow the guide.</p><hr><p>Once the installation is complete, you&rsquo;ll be prompted to promote the server to a domain controller. This is the step where you&rsquo;ll actually configure the Active Directory installation. For this setup, we&rsquo;re going to create a new forest, using the <code>cis527.local</code> root domain name. You&rsquo;ll need to adjust these settings to match the required configuration for the lab assignment. By using a <code>.local</code> top-level domain, we can guarantee that this will never be routable on the global internet. The use of a <code>.local</code> suffix here doesn&rsquo;t actually comply with current DNS standards, but for our internal VM network it will work just fine. Of course, if you are doing this on an actual enterprise system, you may actually use your company&rsquo;s internet domain name here, with a custom prefix for your directory. For example, the K-State Computer Science department might use a domain name of <code>ldap.cs.ksu.edu</code> for this server.</p><p>Next, you&rsquo;ll need to configure the functional level of the domain. If you have older systems in your network, you will want to choose the option here for the oldest domain controller in the domain. Since we&rsquo;re just creating a new system, we can use the latest option here.</p><p>You&rsquo;ll also need to input a password here for Directory Services Restore Mode. In an enterprise setting, this is the password that you&rsquo;ll use if you ever have to restore your domain from a backup, or work with a domain controller that will not boot correctly. So, you&rsquo;d generally make this a unique password, and store it in a safe location. For our example, I&rsquo;m just going to use the password we&rsquo;ve been using for all of our Windows systems, but in practice you would make it much more secure.</p><p>Next are the DNS options. If you are running a separate DNS server in your organization, you&rsquo;ll need to checkmark this box to create a DNS delegation. However, for this lab assignment you won&rsquo;t need to do that, since we aren&rsquo;t trying to combine our Windows and Linux environments.</p><p>Following that, you&rsquo;ll need to configure the NetBIOS name for the domain. In general, this is just the first part of your fully domain name. NetBIOS is a very old protocol that is not commonly used, but some Windows systems will still use it to find resources on a network. You can just accept the default option here, unless a different name would be more reasonable.</p><p>In addition, you&rsquo;ll be able to configure the storage paths on your system. For this example, we&rsquo;ll just keep the default paths. However, on a production server, it might make more sense to store these on a different drive, just in case you have to reinstall the operating system in the future. These are the folders that store the actual database and information for the Active Directory domain.</p><p>Finally, you&rsquo;ll be able to review the options before applying them. If you&rsquo;d like, you can click the &ldquo;View script&rdquo; button to view a PowerShell script that you could use to perform these steps on a Windows Server without a GUI installed.</p><p>With all the settings in place, you can continue with the configuration process. The first step is a prerequisites check to make sure that the server is able to complete the installation. You may get a couple of warnings about weaker cryptography algorithms and DNS server delegation, but you can ignore those for this example. If the prerequisites check is passed, you can click &ldquo;Install&rdquo; to install the service.</p><hr><p>Once it has installed and rebooted, you&rsquo;ll notice that you are now prompted to log in as a domain user. On Windows systems, the domain name is shown before the <code>\</code>, followed by your username. So, in this example, it now wants me to log in as <code>CIS527\Administrator</code>. This is a different account than the Administrator account on the computer itself, which we were using previously. To log in as a local account, you can use the computer name, followed by a <code>\</code> and then the username. If you don&rsquo;t remember the computer name, you can click the &ldquo;How do I sign in to another domain?&rdquo; link below the prompt to find it. For now, we&rsquo;ll log in as the domain administrator account.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve logged in, you&rsquo;ll need to create at least one user on the Active Directory domain. You can find the <strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong> application under the <strong>Tools</strong> menu on the Server Manager. Thankfully, adding a user here is very similar to adding a user in the Computer Management interface on a Windows computer. As before, make sure you uncheck the box labeled &ldquo;User must change password at next logon&rdquo; and checkmark the &ldquo;Password never expires&rdquo; box for now.</p><p>That should get the server all set up! Next, we&rsquo;ll look at adding a Windows 10 computer to your new Active Directory Domain.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=windows-client-configuration>Windows Client Configuration</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL2FyuTx2_8">YouTube Video</a><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/deployment/join-a-computer-to-a-domain rel=external target=_blank>Join a Computer to a Domain</a> from Microsoft Support</li></ul><h4 id=video-transcript>Video Transcript</h4><p>Once you have completely set up your Active Directory Domain, you can begin to add Windows clients to the domain. This video will walk through some of that process, and I&rsquo;ll discuss a few of the steps as we go.</p><p>For this example, I have my Windows 10 VM from the earlier labs. It is on the same network as the domain controller. Before I begin, I&rsquo;ll need to set some static DNS settings on this computer. First, and most importantly, I&rsquo;ll add a DNS entry for the domain controller first, and the second entry can be any of the other working DNS servers on the network. In this case, I&rsquo;ll just use the VMware default gateway.</p><p>Next, I&rsquo;m going to right-click on the Start button and choose the System option. Before adding it to the domain, I need to make sure it is named correctly. If not, I&rsquo;ll need to rename it and reboot before adding it to the domain. Once a computer is on a domain, it is very difficult to rename it.</p><p>Once I&rsquo;m sure it is correct, I&rsquo;m going to click the <strong>System Info</strong> link to get to the old System options in the Control Panel. Here I should be able to see the current workgroup. To add the system to a domain, click the <strong>Change settings</strong> button to the right of the computer name. Then, I&rsquo;ll click the <strong>Change</strong> button to add it to the domain.</p><p>On this window, I&rsquo;ll choose the <strong>Domain</strong> option, and enter the name of the domain, in this case <code>cis527.local</code>, and click OK. You may get a message about the NetBIOS name of the computer being too long, but you can safely ignore that message.</p><p>If everything works correctly, you should see a pop up asking you to enter the username and password of an account with permissions to add a computer to the domain. In this case, the only account we&rsquo;ve set up with those permissions is the domain administrator account, so we&rsquo;ll enter those credentials here. Once you enter it, it should welcome you to the domain, and prompt you to restart.</p><p>If your computer is unable to contact the domain at this step, it is usually a problem with your network configuration. To diagnose the problem, try to ping the domain name using the command-line <code>ping</code> utility and see what the response is. If it cannot find it, then check your network settings and DNS settings and make sure you can ping the domain controller as well. In many cases, this can be one of the more frustrating errors to debug if it happens to you.</p><p>Once the system reboots, you&rsquo;ll be able to log in using any valid credentials for a domain user. As you experienced with the domain controller, you can enter the domain or computer name, followed by a slash, and then the user name to choose which user account to use. Thankfully, here you can always use <code>.\</code> to log in as the local computer. In this case, let&rsquo;s use our domain user account.</p><p>Once you log in, let&rsquo;s take a look at the <strong>Computer Management</strong> interface to see what changed about the users and groups on the system. If you open up the Administrators group, you&rsquo;ll notice that it now includes an entry for <code>CIS527\Domain Admins</code>, and likewise the Users group contains a new entry for <code>CIS527\Domain Users</code>. That means, by default, any user on the domain can now log on to the computer as a user, and anyone on the domain with administrative privileges can log on to any computer on the domain and gain administrator permissions there as well. It is very important to understand these default permissions, so that you can assign them accordingly. For example, in many organizations, you may want to immediately remove the Domain Users entry from the Users group, and add a smaller group instead. You probably don&rsquo;t need folks from the Accounting department logging on to systems in Human Resources, right?</p><p>That&rsquo;s really all there is to it! You&rsquo;ve successfully set up a Windows Active Directory Domain and added your first client computer to it. The next few videos will walk you through the same process on Ubuntu with OpenLDAP.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=windows-group-policy>Windows Group Policy</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6f41Qq6FBM">YouTube Video</a><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><strong><a href=/cis527/4-directory-services/06-windows-group-policy-slides/index.html>Slides</a></strong></li><li><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Policy rel=external target=_blank>Group Policy</a> on Wikipedia</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc785665(v=ws.10)" rel=external target=_blank>Group Policy Processing and Precedence</a> from Microsoft Docs</li><li><a href=https://redmondmag.com/articles/2016/01/12/group-policy-fundamentals.aspx rel=external target=_blank>Group Policy Fundamentals in Active Directory</a> by Troy Thompson in Redmond Magazine</li><li><a href=https://www.howtogeek.com/125171/htg-explains-what-group-policy-is-and-how-you-can-use-it/ rel=external target=_blank>What is Group Policy in Windows</a> from How-To Geek</li><li><a href=https://www.csoonline.com/article/562485/the-10-windows-group-policy-settings-you-need-to-get-right-2.html rel=external target=_blank>The 10 Windows Group Policy Settings you Need to Get Right</a> from CSO Online</li><li><a href=https://www.globalknowledge.com/us-en/content/articles/in-the-trenches-eight-tips-n-tricks-for-microsoft-windows-group-policy/ rel=external target=_blank>In the Trenches: Eight Tips-n-Tricks for Microsoft Windows Group Policy</a> by Mark Mizrahi on Global Knowledge</li><li><a href=https://www.lepide.com/blog/top-10-most-important-group-policy-settings-for-preventing-security-breaches/ rel=external target=_blank>Top 10 Most Important Group Policy Settings for Preventing Security Breaches</a> by Abhishek Rai on Lepide Blog</li><li><a href=https://activedirectorypro.com/group-policy-best-practices/ rel=external target=_blank>Group Policy Best Practices</a> by Robert Allen on Active Directory Pro</li><li><a href=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2008.01.gpperf.aspx rel=external target=_blank>Optimizing Group Policy Performance</a> by Darren Mar-Elia on Microsoft TechNet</li></ul><h4 id=video-transcript>Video Transcript</h4><p>One of the major features of Microsoft&rsquo;s Active Directory is the ability to use Group Policy Objects, or GPOs, to enforce specific security settings on any Windows client added to the domain. For large enterprises, this is a major tool in their arsenal to ensure that Windows PCs are properly configured and secured in their organization.</p><p>Group Policy can be set at both the local computer level, as well as via Active Directory. The settings themselves are hierarchical in nature, so you can easily browse through related settings when using the Group Policy Editor tool. In addition, GPOs are inheritable, and multiple GPOs can be applied to a group or OU in a domain.</p><p>When group policies are applied, they follow this order. First, any policies set locally on the machine are applied, then policies from the Active Directory site, then the global domain itself, and finally any policies applied to the OU containing this computer or user are applied. At each level, any previous settings can be overridden, so in essence, the policies applied at the OU level take precedence over others.</p><p>Some examples of things you can control via Group Policy are shown here. You can create mapped drives, which we will see in a later module. You can also set power options, which could be used in an organization to save money by reducing energy usage. In addition, you can use group policy to enforce password restrictions, and even install printers and printer drivers as well.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at one quick demonstration, setting a password policy for the domain. This tutorial is from Infoworld, and is linked in the resources section below the video.</p><p>Here I have opened my Windows 2016 Server VM as configured for Lab 4. First, I&rsquo;ll open the Group Policy Management Console, which is available on the Tools menu in Windows Server Manager. Next, I&rsquo;ll find my domain, and right-click it to create a GPO in this domain. I&rsquo;ll also give the GPO a helpful name, and click OK to create it.</p><p>Next, I can right-click the policy and choose Edit. In the policy editor, I&rsquo;ll need to dig down the following path:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0><code>&lt;name&gt;\Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy</code></pre></div><p>In that window, we&rsquo;ll right-click the &ldquo;Password Must Meet Complexity Requirements&rdquo; option, and choose <strong>Properties</strong>. Then, we&rsquo;ll enable the setting by checkmarking the box and clicking Enable. You can find more information about the policy by clicking the <strong>Explain</strong> tab at the top.</p><p>Finally, once the policy is configured, you&rsquo;ll need to right-click on it once again, and select the <strong>Enforced</strong> option to enforce it on the domain itself.</p><p>That&rsquo;s all there is to it! Now, any new password created on this domain must meet those complexity requirements. While you won&rsquo;t have to work with Group Policy for this lab assignment, we&rsquo;ll come back to it in a later module as we work with application and file servers.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=ubuntu-ldap-installation>Ubuntu LDAP Installation</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIUDIiAMGrg">YouTube Video</a><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

The goal of this video isn&rsquo;t to show you all the steps of the process, but provide commentary on some of the more confusing steps you&rsquo;ll perform.</p><p>For this example, I&rsquo;m using the Ubuntu VM labelled Server from Lab 3. I have chosen to disable the DHCP server on this system, and instead have replaced it with the VMware DHCP server. In practice, that change should not affect any of this process. Also, I&rsquo;ll generally be following the guide from DigitalOcean, which is linked in the resources section below the video.</p><p>At this point, I have also already performed the first steps of the guide, which is to install the <code>slapd</code> and <code>ldap-utils</code> packages on this system. Now, I&rsquo;ll step through the configuration process for <code>slapd</code> and discuss the various options it presents.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo dpkg-reconfigure slapd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, it will ask you if you want to omit the OpenLDAP server configuration. Make sure you select <code>&lt;No></code> for that option. You can use the arrow keys (<kbd>←</kbd> and <kbd>→</kbd>) to move the red-shaded selector to the option you&rsquo;d like to select, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to confirm it.</p><p>Next, it will ask for your domain name. For this example, I&rsquo;ll just use <code>ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</code>. You&rsquo;ll need to adjust these settings to match the required configuration for the lab assignment. This matches the DNS configuration I made in Lab 3, which is very important later on in this process.</p><p>Next, it will also ask for your organization name. I&rsquo;ll just use <code>cis527</code> here.</p><p>Then, it will ask for your Administrator password. This is the equivalent of the <code>root</code> account within the domain. It is able to change all domain settings, and therefore the password for this account should be very complex and well protected. For this example, I&rsquo;ll just use the same password we are using for everything else, but in practice you&rsquo;ll want to carefully consider this password.</p><p>The next option is whether you want to have the database removed if you purge the <code>slapd</code> package. Selecting <code>&lt;yes></code> on this option would delete your LDAP database if you ever chose to reinstall the <code>slapd</code> package. For most uses, you&rsquo;ll always want to select <code>&lt;no></code> here, which is what I&rsquo;ll do.</p><p>Since there are some existing configuration files in place, the installer asks if you&rsquo;d like those to be moved. Unless you are reinstalling <code>slapd</code> on an existing server, you can select <code>&lt;yes></code> for this option.</p><p>That should complete the configuration for the OpenLDAP server. For this example, I have disabled the firewall on this system, but for your lab assignment you&rsquo;ll need to do a bit of firewall configuration at this point.</p><hr><p>Finally, let&rsquo;s add some encryption to this server to protect the information shared across the network. This step was not required in previous versions of this lab, but it has always been a good idea. Now that Ubuntu uses SSSD, or System Security Services Daemon, for authentication, it requires us to provide TLS encryption on our LDAP server. So, let&rsquo;s do that now.</p><p>For these steps, we&rsquo;ll be closely following the Ubuntu Server Guide linked below this video. We&rsquo;ll be adjusting a few of the items to match our configuration, but most of the commands are exactly the same.</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to install a couple of packages to allow us to create and manipulate security certificates</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt install gnutls-bin ssl-cert</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, we need to create our own certificate authority, or CA. In a production system, you would instead work with an actual CA to obtain a security certificate from them, but that can be time consuming and expensive. So, for this example, we&rsquo;ll just create our own. Also, contrary to what your browser may lead you to believe, using your own CA certificates will result in an encrypted connection, it just may not be &ldquo;trusted&rdquo; since your browser doesn&rsquo;t recognize the CA certificate.</p><p>If you want to know more about CAs and certificates, check out the handy YouTube video I&rsquo;ve linked below this video. It gives a great description of how certificates work in much more detail. I&rsquo;ve also included links to the lectures in Module 3 and Module 5 that deal with TLS certificates.</p><p>So, we&rsquo;ll first create a private key for our CA:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo certtool --generate-privkey --bits <span style=color:#ae81ff>4096</span> --outfile /etc/ssl/private/mycakey.pem</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, we&rsquo;ll create a template file that contains the options we need for creating this certificate. Notice here that I&rsquo;ve modified this information from what is provided in the Ubuntu Server Guide document to match our setup:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo nano /etc/ssl/ca.info</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and put the following text into that file.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>cn = CIS 527
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>ca
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>cert_signing_key
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>expiration_days = 3650</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, we can use that template to create our self-signed certificate authority certificate:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey /etc/ssl/private/mycakey.pem --template /etc/ssl/ca.info --outfile /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mycacert.crt</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will create a certificate called <code>mycacert.crt</code> that is stored in <code>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/</code>. <strong>This is our self-signed CA certificate</strong>. So, whenever we want any system to trust one of our self-signed certificates that we make from our CA, we&rsquo;ll need to make sure that system has a copy of this CA certificate in its list of trusted certificates.</p><p>To do that, we simply place the certificate in <code>/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/</code>, and then run the following command to add it to the list of trusted certificates:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo update-ca-certificates</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If that command works correctly, it should tell us that it has added 1 certificate to our list.</p><p>Before we move on, let&rsquo;s make a copy of our <code>mycacert.crt</code> file in our <code>cis527</code> users&rsquo;s home directory. We&rsquo;ll use this file in the next part of this lab when we are configuring our client system to authenticate using LDAP.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>cp /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mycacert.crt ~/</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now that we&rsquo;ve created our own self-signed CA, we can use it to create a certificate for our LDAP server. So, we&rsquo;ll start by creating yet another private key:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo certtool --generate-privkey --bits <span style=color:#ae81ff>2048</span> --outfile /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_key.pem</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, we&rsquo;ll create another template file to give the information about the certificate that we&rsquo;d like to create:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo nano /etc/ssl/ldap01.info</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and place the following tex in that file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>organization = CIS 527
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>cn = ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>tls_www_server
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>encryption_key
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>signing_key
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>expiration_days = 365</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that in that file, we entered the fully qualified domain name for our LDAP server on the second line. This is the most important part that makes all of this work. On our client machine, we must have a DNS entry that links this domain name to our LDAP server&rsquo;s IP address, and then the certificate the server uses must match that domain name. So, if we don&rsquo;t get this step right, the whole system may not work correctly until we fix it!</p><p>Finally, we can use this long and complex command to create and sign our server&rsquo;s certificate:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_key.pem --load-ca-certificate /etc/ssl/certs/mycacert.pem --load-ca-privkey /etc/ssl/private/mycakey.pem --template /etc/ssl/ldap01.info --outfile /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_cert.pem</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once the certificate has been created, we just need to do a couple of tweaks so that it has the correct permissions. This will allow the LDAP server to properly access the file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo chgrp openldap /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_key.pem
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo chmod <span style=color:#ae81ff>0640</span> /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_key.pem</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, at long last, we are ready to tell our LDAP server to use the certificate. To do that, we&rsquo;ll create an LDIF file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>nano ~/certinfo.ldif</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and in that file we&rsquo;ll put the information about our certificate:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>dn: cn=config
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>add: olcTLSCACertificateFile
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>olcTLSCACertificateFile: /etc/ssl/certs/mycacert.pem
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>-
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>add: olcTLSCertificateFile
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>olcTLSCertificateFile: /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_cert.pem
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>-
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>add: olcTLSCertificateKeyFile
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>olcTLSCertificateKeyFile: /etc/ldap/ldap01_slapd_key.pem</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once that file is created, we can use the <code>ldapmodify</code> tool to import it into our server:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo ldapmodify -Y EXTERNAL -H ldapi:/// -f certinfo.ldif</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Whew! That was a lot of work! Now, if we did everything correctly, we should be able to query this LDAP server using TLS. The best way to check that is by using the following command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>ldapwhoami -x -ZZ -h ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The <code>-ZZ</code> part of that command tells it to use TLS, and if it works correctly it should return <code>anonymous</code> as the result. If this step fails, then you may need to do some troubleshooting to see what the problem is.</p><p>That should do it! In the next video, I&rsquo;ll show how to configure another Ubuntu VM to use this LDAP server for authentication.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=ubuntu-client-configuration>Ubuntu Client Configuration</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTDsiX90KCQ">YouTube Video</a><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/ldap-and-transport-layer-security-tls rel=external target=_blank>SSSD and LDAP</a> on Ubuntu Server Guide</li></ul><h4 id=video-transcript>Video Transcript</h4><p>Once we&rsquo;ve set up and configured our OpenLDAP server on Linux, we can configure another VM to act as an LDAP client and use that server for authentication. Thankfully, now that Ubuntu 20.04 uses SSSD, this process is pretty simple.</p><p>For the most part, we&rsquo;ll be following the instructions in the Ubuntu Server Guide page linked below this video. It is a pretty in-depth overview of how to configure SSSD to use LDAP for authentication. In fact, if you&rsquo;ve done the Windows portions of this assignment already, you&rsquo;ll be familiar with several of these steps.</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to install a couple of packages on this system to allow us to interact with LDAP systems via SSSD:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt install sssd-ldap ldap-utils</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll need to get a copy of our certificate authority, or CA, certificate from our Ubuntu 20.04 VM labelled <strong>SERVER</strong>. If we followed the instructions in the previous video correctly, we should have created a copy of that file in the home directory of the <code>cis527</code> user on our server.</p><p>If not, you can do so by logging on to the <strong>SERVER</strong> VM as <code>cis527</code> and using the following command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>cp /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mycacert.crt ~/</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Then, from the <strong>CLIENT</strong> VM, we can use <code>scp</code> to copy that file using SSH. Hopefully you were able to get the SSH portion of the lab set up and working correctly. If not, you may have to copy this from the <strong>SERVER</strong> VM to your host system, and then from your host system back to the <strong>CLIENT</strong> VM. To copy the file using <code>scp</code>, use a command similar to the following</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>scp -P <span style=color:#ae81ff>22222</span> cis527@192.168.40.41:~/mycacert.crt ~/</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Let&rsquo;s break that command down. First, the <code>-P 22222</code> tells us the we are using port 22222 to connect to the system, which is how it was configured in Lab 3. Then, we have <code>cis527@</code>, which is the username we&rsquo;d like to use on the remote system, followed by <code>192.168.40.41</code>, which is the IP address of our <strong>SERVER</strong> VM. Next, there is a colon, and a file path, which is <code>~/mycacert.crt</code>, which is the path to the certificate file on the <strong>SERVER</strong> VM. Finally, we have a space, and another path <code>~/</code> showing where we&rsquo;d like to place the file on our <strong>CLIENT</strong> VM.</p><p>Of course, if you want to learn more about SSH and SCP, check out the video in the Extras section for more information.</p><p>Once we have a copy of the certificate on our <strong>CLIENT</strong> VM, we can install it using the following commands:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo cp ~/mycacert.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo update-ca-certificates</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If that command works correctly, it should tell us that it has added 1 certificate to our list. That means that our <strong>CLIENT</strong> VM now includes our own self-signed CA in its list of trusted CA certificates. That&rsquo;s what we want!</p><hr><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll need to create an SSSD configuration file. Unfortunately, unlike the example we&rsquo;ll see later with Windows and Active Directory, we&rsquo;ll have to create this one manually. Here&rsquo;s an example of what that would look like. First, we&rsquo;ll open the file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo nano /etc/sssd/sssd.conf</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and then put the following contents inside of it:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>[sssd]
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>config_file_version = 2
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>domains = ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>[domain/ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu]
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>id_provider = ldap
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>auth_provider = ldap
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>ldap_uri = ldap://ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>cache_credentials = True
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>ldap_search_base = dc=ldap,dc=cis527russfeld,dc=cs,dc=ksu,dc=edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Notice that we&rsquo;ve customized this file to match our LDAP configuration information from the previous video.</p><p>Also, we must make sure that that file is owned by <code>root:root</code> and only the user has permission to access that file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo chown root:root /etc/sssd/sssd.conf
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo chmod <span style=color:#ae81ff>600</span> /etc/sssd/sssd.conf</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we can restart the SSSD service to load the new settings:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl restart sssd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If this command returns an error, it usually either means that there is a typo in the <code>sssd.conf</code> file created earlier, or that the file&rsquo;s permissions are incorrect. So, make sure you double-check that if you run into an error at this point.</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s tackle the creation of home directories. This is handled by the Pluggable Authentication Modules, or PAM, framework. There are many ways to do this, including editing a config file manually. However, there is a quick and easy way to do this as well, using the <code>pam-auth-update</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo pam-auth-update</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the menu, press the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key to enable the &ldquo;Create home directory on login&rdquo; option, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to save the changes.</p><p>Finally, we can do some testing to make sure that things are working correctly. First, we&rsquo;ll need to be able to access our LDAP server using its DNS name, so we can test that using dig:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>dig ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hopefully you were able to get your LDAP server working in the previous lab. If not, you may load some of the model solution files from Lab 3 provided on Canvas to get this part working.</p><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll make sure we can access the LDAP server</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>ldapwhoami -x -h ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command should return <code>anonymous</code>. If not, your <strong>CLIENT</strong> VM is having trouble contacting your <strong>SERVER</strong> VM or the LDAP server itself. In that case, you may want to check your firewall configuration - did you remember to allow the correct ports for LDAP?</p><p>Once that command works, we can try it again using TLS by adding <code>-ZZ</code> to the command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>ldapwhoami -x -ZZ -h ldap.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hopefully this command should return <code>anonymous</code> just like it did previously. If not, there is probably a configuration issue with your TLS certificates that you&rsquo;ll need to resolve before moving on.</p><p>Finally, if everything looks like it is working, we can try to load information about one of our LDAP users using the <code>getent</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>getent passwd russfeld</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This command should return information about the user we created on our LDAP server. If not, then we may need to check the settings in our <code>sssd.conf</code> file to make sure the LDAP information is correct.</p><p>Thankfully, if that worked, we can try to log on to the system as that user using the <code>su</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>su russfeld</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It works! We can even go to our home directory and see that it was created for us:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>cd ~/
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>pwd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, at this point, I should point out one very important impact of how our system is configured. I am logged in as an LDAP user, but notice that if I try to log in as root, I&rsquo;m able to use <code>sudo</code> without any additional configuration! <strong>Yikes!</strong></p><p>How did that happen? It actually is due to a setting in our <code>sudoers</code> file that is present by default on all Ubuntu systems. Let&rsquo;s take a look at that file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo visudo</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If we look through that file, we&rsquo;ll find a line that says members of the <code>admin</code> group may gain root privileges. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly what happened! Just because we chose to name our group <code>admin</code> on the LDAP server, our users would automatically gain <code>sudo</code> access on any system they log into. The same would happen for a group named <code>sudo</code> as well. So, it is very important to make sure your groups on your LDAP server use unique names, otherwise you may inadvertently create a major security hole in your systems.</p><p>To test the graphical login, you&rsquo;ll need to fully reboot your computer. Once that is done, you can click the &ldquo;Not listed?&rdquo; option at the bottom of the list of users, then enter the credentials for your LDAP user to log in. If everything is configured correctly, it should let you log in directly to the system.</p><p>You have now successfully configured your system to allow Ubuntu to use LDAP servers for user accounts. This should be enough information to help you complete that section of Lab 4. As always, if you have any questions, feel free to post in the course discussion forums on Canvas. Good luck!</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=linux-client-on-windows-domain>Linux Client on Windows Domain</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyie_GWK2zw">YouTube Video</a><h4 id=resources>Resources</h4><ul><li><a href=https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/how-to-set-up-sssd-with-active-directory rel=external target=_blank>SSSD and Active Directory</a> from Ubuntu</li><li><a href="https://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=Ubuntu_20.04&p=realmd" rel=external target=_blank>Join in Active Directory Domain</a> from Server-World (works for 24.04)</li><li><a href=https://computingforgeeks.com/join-ubuntu-debian-to-active-directory-ad-domain/ rel=external target=_blank>How to Join Ubuntu 18.04 / Debian 10 To Active Directory (AD) Domain</a> from Computingforgeeks (works for 24.04)</li></ul><h4 id=video-transcript>Video Transcript</h4><p>In the following two videos, we&rsquo;ll look at how to enable interoperability between our Windows- and Linux-based systems. In many organizations today, you&rsquo;ll have a mix of many different operating systems, so it is very helpful to understand how to integrate them together in a single directory service.</p><p>In this video, I&rsquo;ll show you how to add an Ubuntu VM to a Windows Active Directory Domain. This is by far the most common use-case for interoperability, and has been used by many organizations including K-State. For most users, Windows Active Directory provides a great set of features for Windows-based systems, and it is simple to integrate Linux and Mac clients into that environment.</p><p>For this example, I&rsquo;m using the Windows 2019 server set up as defined in Lab 4&rsquo;s assignment. I&rsquo;ve reconfigured the domain to have the fully qualified domain name <code>ad.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</code> for this example, as you would in a real environment. This is due to the fact that many Linux packages do not accept the <code>.local</code> top-level domain I used in the previous video as an example.</p><p>For the client, I am using a copy of my Ubuntu 20.04 VM labelled <strong>CLIENT</strong> from Lab 3. For this assignment, you&rsquo;ll use that same VM, but restored to a snapshot taken before it was configured as a client for OpenLDAP. Remember that you&rsquo;ll need create this snapshot before you start the Lab 4 assignment, or else you may need to create a new VM for this activity.</p><p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve found there really isn&rsquo;t a great guide for doing this online, but I&rsquo;m generally following the instructions in the Server-World guide linked below this video. I&rsquo;ll do my best to clarify what parts are important and what parts I leave out and why.</p><p>First, as with any client I wish to add to a domain, I&rsquo;ll need to set a static DNS entry to point to the domain controller itself. For the second entry, I&rsquo;ll just use the VMware router as always. Once I&rsquo;ve done that, I&rsquo;ll disable and enable the network connection so that my changes take effect.</p><p>Then, I&rsquo;ll need to install the <code>realmd</code> package. This package allows us to interface with Active Directory Domain servers.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt install realmd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The instructions found online typically have you install a large number of packages at this step, but don&rsquo;t do a good job of describing what they are used for. Thankfully, Ubuntu 20.04 includes a special program called <code>packagekit</code> by default, which allows us to automatically install the packages we need as we need them. So, we&rsquo;ll start by just installing <code>realmd</code> and going from there.</p><p>Once we have <code>realmd</code> installed, we can use it to query our Active Directory domain using the <code>realm discover</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>realm discover ad.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If that command works correctly, you should see output giving information about the Active Directory Domain we just queried. However, if you get an error at this step, that usually means that something isn&rsquo;t working correctly. In that case, double-check that you have properly set your DNS entries, and that you can ping your Windows 2019 server using both the IP address and the Active Directory Domain name. You&rsquo;ll need to be able to use DNS to resolve that domain name in order for this system to join the domain.</p><p>Once we are ready to join the domain, we can simply using the <code>sudo realm join</code> command.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo realm join ad.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Once we enter that command, we&rsquo;ll be prompted for the password for the <code>Administrator</code> account. This is the <code>Administrator</code> account of our Active Directory domain, so we&rsquo;ll have to provide the correct password here.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where the cool part happens. The <code>realmd</code> program is smart enough to know what packages we need in order to interface with an Active Directory domain, and because we have <code>packagekit</code> installed on Ubuntu 20.04 by default, the <code>realmd</code> command can automatically install those packages when we use the <code>realm join</code> command. So, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about remembering to install all of these packages manually - it is done for us automatically! Very handy!</p><p>Ok, now that we have joined the domain, we can see if we can get information about an Active Directory user account using the <code>id</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>id russfeld@ad.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If everything is working correctly, you should see some information about that user printed to the screen. If not, you&rsquo;ll need to do some troubleshooting.</p><p>Now, we can even log in as that user using the <code>su</code>, or &ldquo;switch user&rdquo; command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>su russfeld@ad.cis527russfeld.cs.ksu.edu</span></span></code></pre></div><p>There we go! We are now logged in to this system as one of our Active Directory users. However, there are couple of things we can do to improve this experience. First, notice that we have to enter our fully qualified domain name for our Active Directory domain to log in. That can get really annoying, espeically with a long domain like ours. Also, what if we try to check our home directory:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>cd ~/</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We find out that this user doesn&rsquo;t even have a home directory to store files in. That&rsquo;s no good!</p><p>So, let&rsquo;s log out of this user and try to fix these issues.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>exit</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, let&rsquo;s change a setting so that we don&rsquo;t have to enter the full Active Directory Domain name each time we want to log in as one of those users. To do that, we&rsquo;ll edit the <code>sssd</code> configuration file. The <code>sssd</code> package helps provide access to authentication resources across many different sources.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo nano /etc/sssd/sssd.conf</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In that file, we&rsquo;ll see a line like the following:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>use_fully_qualified_names = True</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll simply set that setting to <code>False</code> and then save the file.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-tex data-lang=tex><span style=display:flex><span>use_fully_qualified_names = False</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Finally, we can restart the <code>sssd</code> daemon to load the new settings.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl restart sssd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, we can use the <code>id</code> command with just the username:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>id russfeld</span></span></code></pre></div><p>and we should get the correct info. We can even use that username to log in to the system using the <code>su</code> command.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>su russfeld
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>exit</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Yay! Now, let&rsquo;s tackle the creation of home directories. This is handled by the Pluggable Authentication Modules, or PAM, framework. There are many ways to do this, including editing a config file manually. However, there is a quick and easy way to do this as well, using the <code>pam-auth-update</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo pam-auth-update</span></span></code></pre></div><p>In the menu, press the <kbd>SPACE</kbd> key to enable the &ldquo;Create home directory on login&rdquo; option, then press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to save the changes.</p><p>There we go! Now, when we log in as our domain user, it will automatically create a home directory for us:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>su russfeld
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>cd ~/
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>pwd</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Awesome! Now, one interesting thing to discuss at this point is the fact that many online tutorials require us to install the <code>oddjob</code> and <code>oddjob-mkhomedir</code> packages. As far as I can tell, these are only required if we are using <code>selinux</code> instead of <code>apparmor</code> to protect our system. Since we aren&rsquo;t doing that, we&rsquo;ll just leave this out for now. However, if you do decide to use <code>selinux</code> on your system, you may have to do some additional configuration in order for your home directories to be properly created.</p><p>Ok, the last thing we may want to tackle on this system is the ability for our domain users to log on graphically. In previous versions of Ubuntu, this required a bit more configuration. However, in Ubuntu 20.04, all we have to do is restart the system to reload a few of the changes we just made. Then, we can click the &ldquo;Not listed?&rdquo; option at the bottom of the login window, and enter our domain username and password.</p><p>Voila! That&rsquo;s all it takes to log on graphically using an Active Directory domain user account on Ubuntu 20.04. The process has gotten much simpler over the years, to the point where it isn&rsquo;t that much more difficult than adding a Windows 10 client to a domain.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=windows-client-on-linux-domain>Windows Client on Linux Domain</h1><details open class="box cstyle notices note"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i>

Unfortunately, at this time it is not straightforward at all to use OpenLDAP as the server, hence the decision to use Samba instead. This is a much more complicated process than adding Ubuntu as a client to an existing Active Directory Domain, but I feel that it is important to see that it is indeed possible. This is helpful if your organization is primarily Linux-based, but you wish to include a few Windows clients on the network as well.</p><p>For this example, I&rsquo;m using the Ubuntu VM labelled <strong>Client</strong> from earlier in this lab. I&rsquo;ve created a snapshot to store the work done previously to add it to an OpenLDAP domain, but now I&rsquo;ve restored the snapshot labelled &ldquo;Before Lab 4&rdquo; and will use that snapshot to create a Samba server. The reason I am doing this on the VM labelled <strong>Client</strong> and not the one labelled <strong>Server</strong> is because the Samba installation will directly conflict with Bind9, OpenLDAP, and many other tools we&rsquo;ve already installed on the server. So, this allows us to avoid any conflicts with those tools.</p><p>For the client, I have restored my Windows 10 VM to a snapshot taken before it was added to my Active Directory Domain. Remember that you&rsquo;ll need to create this snapshot before you start the Lab 4 assignment, or else you may need to create a new VM for this activity.</p><p>Finally, I&rsquo;ll generally be following the great guide by Jack Wallen that is linked in the resources section below this video, but I&rsquo;ll be making a few minor changes to match our environment and clarifying a few things that he leaves out.</p><p>Before we begin, we&rsquo;ll need to set a static IP on this system, since it will be acting as a server. I&rsquo;m going to use the IP ending in <code>45</code> in my local subnet. For the DNS entries, we&rsquo;ll also need to set the first entry to be this system itself, just like we did with the Windows Domain Controller. The second DNS entry can be the VMware router or any other valid DNS server.</p><p>First, we&rsquo;ll need to install Samba as well as a few supporting tools:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt update
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo apt install samba libpam-winbind smbclient</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This will install many supporting packages as well.</p><p>Next, we need to make a few edits to our <code>hosts</code> file as well as update our hostname. This will help Samba find the correct settings as we configure it in a later step. First, let&rsquo;s edit the <code>hosts</code> file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo nano /etc/hosts</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;ll need to add or edit a few entries at the top of this file. Here&rsquo;s what mine currently looks like:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0><code>127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain
127.0.1.1       dc
192.168.40.41   localhost
192.168.40.41   smbrussfeld.cis527.cs.ksu.edu       smbrussfeld
192.168.40.41   dc.smbrussfeld.cis527.cs.ksu.edu    dc</code></pre></div><p>The first line is updated to be <code>localhost.localdomain</code>, just to make it clear that that IP address is for the loopback adapter. The second line gives the new hostname for this system. In this case, I&rsquo;m calling it <code>dc</code> for domain controller. The third line redirects the <code>localhost</code> domain name to the external IP address. Finally, the fourth and fifth lines give the name of the domain as well as the fully qualified domain name for this system, respectively.</p><p>To go along with this change, we&rsquo;ll edit the <code>hostname</code> file as well:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo nano /etc/hostname</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It should now be the same as the hostname used in the <code>hosts</code> file:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0><code>dc</code></pre></div><p>Finally, we&rsquo;ll need to restart the computer for these changes to take effect.</p><p>Once it has restarted, we&rsquo;ll need to remove any existing Samba configuration files and database files.</p><p>Thankfully, there are some great commands for finding the location of those files. First, you can find the location of the config file using this command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>smbd -b | grep <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;CONFIGFILE&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is usually at <code>/etc/samba/smb.conf</code>. So, to delete it, you&rsquo;ll use:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo rm -f /etc/samba/smb.conf</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, you can find the locations of all database files using this command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>smbd -b | egrep <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;LOCKDIR|STATEDIR|CACHEDIR|PRIVATE_DIR&#34;</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>It should give you four different directory paths. So, for each of those directories, you&rsquo;ll need to enter that directory, then delete all files with the <code>.tdb</code> and <code>.ldb</code> file extensions. So, for the first one, you could use these commands:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0><code>cd /var/run/samba
sudo rm -f *.tdb *.ldb</code></pre></div><p>Repeat that process for the other three directories to make sure they are all clear.</p><p>Once that is done, it is time to create our new domain. We&rsquo;ll use the <code>samba-tool</code> command to do this in interactive mode:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo samba-tool domain provision --use-rfc2307 --interactive</span></span></code></pre></div><p>First, it will ask you for the realm. For this example, I&rsquo;ll use the name <code>smbrussfeld.cis527.cs.ksu.edu</code>. Following that, it should ask you for the NetBIOS name of your domain. The default should be <code>smbrussfeld</code>, which is fine. You can also accept the defaults of <code>dc</code> for the server role, and <code>SAMBA_INTERNAL</code> for the DNS backend. For the DNS forwarder address, you can use the VMware router&rsquo;s IP address, or any other valid DNS server address from Lab 3. Finally, you&rsquo;ll need to enter a password for the Administrator account. I&rsquo;ll use the same password as always.</p><p>Once you&rsquo;ve entered that information, your domain will be configured. Now, we&rsquo;ll need to add a user to Samba and enable it using the following commands:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo smbpasswd -a &lt;username&gt;
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo smbpasswd -e &lt;username&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Next, we&rsquo;ll need to disable the <code>systemd-resolved</code> service. This service is installed by default on Ubuntu 18.04, and is responsible for caching local DNS queries. However, since it binds to port 53, it will prevent our Samba server from binding to that port. To disable it, we&rsquo;ll use the following commands:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We&rsquo;ll also need to disable the existing Samba services, and enable the Samba Domain Controller service:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl disable nmbd
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl stop nmbd
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl disable smbd
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl stop smbd
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl unmask samba-ad-dc
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl enable samba-ad-dc
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>sudo systemctl start samba-ad-dc</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Lastly, we&rsquo;ll need to replace any existing Kerberos configuration file with the one created by Samba. So, you&rsquo;ll perform these commands to delete the existing file (if any) and create a symbolic link to the one from Samba.</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>sudo mv /etc/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf.orig
</span></span><span style=display:flex><span>​sudo ln -sf /var/lib/samba/private/krb5.conf /etc/krb5.conf</span></span></code></pre></div><p>If you get an error from the first command, you can safely ignore it.</p><p>Finally, if everything is configured correctly, we can query our domain using the <code>smbclient</code> command:</p><div class=highlight dir=auto><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span style=display:flex><span>smbclient -L localhost -U%</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Hopefully you should get output from that command giving information about your domain. If not, you&rsquo;ll probably need to review the Samba log file stored in <code>/var/log/samba/log.samba</code> to see what the error is.</p><p>If everything is working correctly, you can then add your Windows 10 VM to the domain. First, as with any client I wish to add to a domain, I&rsquo;ll need to set a static DNS entry to point to the domain controller itself. For the second entry, I&rsquo;ll just use the VMware router as always. Then, I can add it to the domain following the instructions in the earlier video.</p><p>After a reboot, it should allow you to log in as the domain user created earlier.</p><p>It is quite a process, but hopefully this demonstrates what it takes to create an Active Directory Domain using Samba. I highly recommend that you try this process at least once, even if you don&rsquo;t plan on completing it as part of Lab 4, just to see how it all works together.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=ad-and-netbios-names>AD and NETBIOS Names</h1><p>It appears that I have managed to confuse lots of people with the Windows AD portion of this lab. That&rsquo;s not my intent, and any confusion is totally my fault here. This is mostly due to the fact that I reused an older video showing how to set up an Active Directory server and not clearly describing how things should be changed. I&rsquo;ll do my best to clarify what you need to know and how you can adapt any existing setup you may have so that it works.</p><p>When configuring an Active Directory (AD) domain, there are two important settings: the <strong>root domain name</strong> (numbered 1 in the screenshots below) and the <strong>NETBIOS domain name</strong> (numbered 2 in the screenshots below).</p><p>In an ideal setup, those names are closely related. Typically, if the <strong>root domain name</strong> is <code>ad.russfeld.cis527.org</code> then the <strong>NETBIOS domain name</strong> would be <code>ad</code> - the first part of the <strong>root domain name</strong>. In most cases, you <em>should not change</em> the <strong>NETBIOS domain name</strong> from the default that is proposed by the setup process. (<em>If you did, that&rsquo;s fine - keep reading!</em>)</p><p>In the video for setting up an AD domain, I used a simplified root domain name <code>cis527.local</code>, which meant that my NETBIOS domain name would be <code>cis527</code> as shown in the screenshots below:</p><p><a href=#R-image-9b467194e2924ff0a4f990312b447837 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Root Domain Name" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/adds1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

However, I do not specify the <strong>NETBIOS domain name</strong>, which should default to <code>ad</code>. However, you can freely change it, and I believe that the video is leading many students to change that value to either <code>cis527</code> or <code>&lt;your eID></code>. To be clear, you <em>should not change</em> the <strong>NETBIOS domain name</strong> at this step - whatever is proposed by the configuration wizard is correct.</p><p><em><strong>If you&rsquo;ve changed this, that&rsquo;s fine! You&rsquo;ll just have to adapt a couple of things further down the line.</strong></em></p><p>To see how your domain is set up, open the <strong>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong> tool in your Windows Server VM, and find the user you created in the <strong>Users</strong> folder and open it. There should be an <strong>Account</strong> tab that looks like the following screenshot (this is from a different VM setup, so the domain names are purposefully different than what the lab specifies):</p><p><a href=#R-image-b0e99f84fbdc69675c10f151cd14bbbb class=lightbox-link><img alt="AD Account Tab" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/adds3.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

This is the VM that I used for creating the <a href=/cis527/4-directory-services/09-linux-client-on-windows-domain/index.html>Linux Client on Windows Domain</a> video that was new for Summer 2020. So, make note of both of these settings in your AD configuration, as you&rsquo;ll need them when trying to log on to the domain or run commands.</p><p>When referencing usernames on an AD domain, there are two basic methods:</p><ol><li><code>&lt;username>@&lt;root domain name></code></li><li><code>&lt;NETBIOS domain name>\&lt;username></code></li></ol><p>So, when I want to log in as that user on Ubuntu, I would use method 1 with the <strong>root domain name</strong> (this is before we change the <code>sssd</code> configuration file to not require the full domain name):</p><p><a href=#R-image-50d9a50050d9cc772b86f53a7f4f1a11 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Ubuntu AD Login" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/adds4.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

For example, my root domain name is <code>ad.&lt;eID>.cis527.org</code> but I set my NETBIOS domain name to <code>cis527&lt;eID></code>.</strong></em></p><p>As far as I can tell, you should still be able to complete Lab 4 with an AD domain configured in this way. The only issues you may run into are when using the <code>realm join</code> command and the <code>ldapsearch</code> commands on Ubuntu. You&rsquo;ll have to pay close attention to which method is being used, and adjust the commands as necessary to fit the situation. So far, I&rsquo;ve worked with at least two students who ran into this issue but were able to get it to work with minimal problems.</p><p>It may also be very important to make sure that both your Windows client and Ubuntu client are configured to use the Windows AD server as the first DNS entry. I usually just set a static DNS entry on each of those systems before joining the domain as directed in the video - in the real world you&rsquo;d have your DHCP server do this for you.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=lab-4-networking-diagrams>Lab 4 Networking Diagrams</h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1fsWJJaUIM">YouTube Video</a><p>Here are some helpful networking diagrams to better explain the desired state before and after the end of Lab 4. In all of these diagrams, I am using a sample network with the IP address <code>192.168.40.0</code>. You will have to adapt the IPs to match your network configuration.

Recall that all systems are currently configured to get DHCP and DNS information from your Ubuntu VM labelled Server, so in general it must be running at all times for this network to function. In addition, the Ubuntu VM labelled Server does not use itself for DNS, but still uses the VMare built-in DNS server, though you may have configured an alternate entry so it can refer to itself for DNS as well. This is the most likely starting point for this lab if you completed Lab 3.</p><h3 id=starting-lab-4-with-a-working-lab-3-solution>Starting Lab 4 with a Working Lab 3 Solution</h3><p><a href=#R-image-e53ac8f1759ffeb8ed890e4bc64ffb46 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Before Lab 4 with Working Lab 3" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/net-beforelab4working3.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In Lab 4, most of the changes required to get from the final Lab 3 network to this configuration are spread across multiple tasks. However, here are the major highlights:</p><ol start=0><li><strong>VMware NAT Network</strong> - the built-in DHCP server should still be disabled as it was in Lab 3.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Server VM</strong> - now uses itself as a primary DNS entry, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 4). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM</strong> - no changes, still gets both DNS and DHCP from the Ubuntu Server VM (Lab 4, Task 5). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Windows Server VM</strong> - new VM (Lab 4, Task 1). Should have a static IP address of <code>192.168.40.42</code> and a primary static DNS entry pointing to itself, with an alternate entry set to the Ubuntu Server VM or the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 2). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> - now has a static DNS entry to point to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the Ubuntu Server VM or the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 3). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM - Windows Snapshot</strong> - when configuring the Ubuntu Client VM to connect to Windows Active Directory, it should have a static DNS entry pointing to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the Ubuntu Server VM or the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 6). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li></ol><p>This is the ideal setup for a this lab, but it depends on a fully working Lab 3 solution. In addition, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the Ubuntu Server VM running at all times, which may present a problem on systems that struggle to run multiple VMs concurrently. So, below I discuss two alternative options.</p><h4 id=lab-4-alternative-network-setup---option-1-static-dns-entries>Lab 4 Alternative Network Setup - Option 1 (Static DNS Entries)</h4><p><a href=#R-image-da11179b277c0fb578b698a6e5abc32b class=lightbox-link><img alt="Before Lab 4 Alternate 1" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/net-beforelab4alt1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In addition, we are avoiding using our own DNS server running on the Ubuntu Server VM unless absolutely necessary. So, the following changes are made to the network from Lab 3:</p><ol start=0><li><strong>VMware NAT Network</strong> - the built-in DHCP server must be re-enabled if it was disabled in Lab 3.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Server VM</strong> - now uses itself as a primary DNS entry, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 4). The DHCP server that was configured in Lab 3 is disabled using <code>sudo systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server</code>. Must still be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM</strong> - now gets a DHCP address from VMware. We must set a primary static DNS entry to point to the Ubuntu Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 5). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Windows Server VM</strong> - new VM (Lab 4, Task 1). Should have a static IP address of <code>192.168.40.42</code> and a primary static DNS entry pointing to itself, with an alternate entry set to the the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 2). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> - now has a static DNS entry to point to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 3). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM - Windows Snapshot</strong> - when configuring the Ubuntu Client VM to connect to Windows Active Directory, it should have a static DNS entry pointing to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 6). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li></ol><p>In effect, each system that is getting automatic IP addresses is now using the VMware DHCP server. However, since that DHCP server does not give the correct DNS addresses, we must set static DNS entries on <strong>everything</strong>, with the Ubuntu Server VM and Ubuntu Client VM pointing to the DNS server running on the Ubuntu Server VM, and the Windows Server, Windows 10 Client, and the Ubuntu Client VM&rsquo;s Windows Snapshot pointing to the DNS server running on the Windows Server (after Active Directory is installed). In addition, each of those systems should have an alternate DNS entry that points to the VMware DNS server, allowing them to still access the internet properly.</p><p>However, if you are still having issues with your DNS entries or DNS servers not working correctly, fear not! There is one more alternative option available to you.</p><h4 id=lab-4-alternative-network-setup---option-2-hosts-file-entries>Lab 4 Alternative Network Setup - Option 2 (Hosts File Entries)</h4><p><a href=#R-image-528abbaf9600c627e56b43e2df1d7c4c class=lightbox-link><img alt="Before Lab 4 Alternate 2" class="border lazy lightbox figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/net-beforelab4alt2.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In addition, we are avoiding using our own DNS server running on the Ubuntu Server VM unless absolutely necessary. Finally, we are adding entries to the <code>hosts</code> file on each system to bypass DNS completely, ensuring that we can still complete this lab even if our DNS systems are not working at all. So, the following changes are made to the network from Lab 3:</p><ol start=0><li><strong>VMware NAT Network</strong> - the built-in DHCP server must be re-enabled if it was disabled in Lab 3.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Server VM</strong> - now uses itself as a primary DNS entry, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 4). The DHCP server that was configured in Lab 3 is disabled using <code>sudo systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server</code>. Must still be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.

We must set a primary static DNS entry to point to the Ubuntu Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 5). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.41</code> to <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Windows Server VM</strong> - new VM (Lab 4, Task 1). Should have a static IP address of <code>192.168.40.42</code> and a primary static DNS entry pointing to itself, with an alternate entry set to the the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 2). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, you are better off just rebuilding your AD server - this should always work on a working AD server!</li><li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> - now has a static DNS entry to point to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 3). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.42</code> to <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM - Windows Snapshot</strong> - when configuring the Ubuntu Client VM to connect to Windows Active Directory, it should have a static DNS entry pointing to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 6). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.42</code> to <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li></ol><p>In essence, we still configure each system with the correct static DNS entries. However, as a fallback in case those DNS entries are not working properly, we can use entries in the <code>hosts</code> file to bypass DNS completely and guarantee that we&rsquo;re always going to get to the correct system.</p><p>This is a very useful workaround, and while an <em>ideal</em> network in the real world shouldn&rsquo;t require it, many times system administrators include entries in the <code>hosts</code> file to ensure that systems can still be used in the event of DNS failure. Otherwise, an innocuous DNS failure could prevent users from even logging on to the system, either via LDAP or Active Directory.</p><p>As shown in the diagram above, the only DNS entry that <strong>must</strong> work is the Windows Server VM must be able to use itself for DNS. If that does not work, then most likely your Active Directory configuration failed and you will need to try again. Windows Active Directory relies heavily on DNS to function properly. I&rsquo;ve not ever had this happen in my experience, so I highly doubt this failure case will be common.</p><p>You can find more information about how to edit your hosts file at <a href=https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/hosts-file/ rel=external target=_blank>this resource</a>.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article><article class=default><header class=headline></header><h1 id=creating-azure-vms>Creating Azure VMs</h1><details open class="box cstyle notices warning"><summary class=box-label tabindex=-1><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i>
Warning</summary><div class=box-content><p>I failed to mention in the video that you cannot use the Remote Desktop Connection to access Azure VMs while on the K-State Campus Network. K-State has blocked all outgoing RDP connections. So, you must either work from a network location that is not on campus, or use a VPN to access a network outside of K-State.</p></div></details><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKhxgns0Gjg">YouTube Video</a><h2 id=edited-transcript>Edited Transcript</h2><p>In this video, I&rsquo;m going to go through the process of setting up a virtual machine in Azure for the system administration class. This is really useful for students that either have a newer MacBook that aren&rsquo;t able to virtualize Windows Server yet, but it&rsquo;s also useful for anybody that either has a lower powered system that wants to virtualize things in the cloud, or if you just want to get more experience working with Azure as a cloud service provider. So to get access to Azure, we&rsquo;re going to start at the CS support page, which is support .cs .ksu .edu. And in here under the FAQs, there&rsquo;s a link right here that says, I need some software by Microsoft. If you click that link, that will take you to this page. And right here, it has this link for the Microsoft Azure DevTools for Teaching. This link tends to change over time, but this page will always be kept up to date with the correct link. So I&rsquo;m going to click that link, and it&rsquo;s going to take me to a page where I can sign in. This used to use a different account system. Now it actually uses your K -State single sign -on account. So I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and sign in to Azure using that account. It&rsquo;s going to take me to my organization sign -in page. So I&rsquo;ll sign in through K -State. It may need to do two factor if it needs to. And then it will pop in and take me to this page.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to tell it to stay signed in because this is my computer. On a shared computer, you might not want to do that. Here, it looks like I&rsquo;ve got an error fetching tenants. I&rsquo;m just going to refresh this page real quick to make sure that it is able to fetch everything. There we go. Okay, so here on this education overview, you should see your available credits. Hopefully you&rsquo;ve got credits available. If not, there is a place where you can go to renew these, and we&rsquo;ll look at that in just a minute. But what I&rsquo;m going to do is I&rsquo;m going to switch over to the Azure virtual machine dashboard. So I&rsquo;m going to go over here to this menu, and I&rsquo;m going to choose dashboard. And so this takes me to the dashboard. Right now, there&rsquo;s no resources to display or anything. And if I go down here to all resources, it will also show me all of the resources that are available. There&rsquo;s some other options here, such as virtual. virtual machines and load balancers and everything like that. So there&rsquo;s a lot of different things that you can look at here on this resources. So feel free to play around with this and see what all is available. It will keep track of recents. For example, there is a view for subscriptions. And so if you find the view for subscriptions, this is where I can actually see your Azure for students. If you need to renew it, I believe you can do it from this view right here. So you just have to find subscriptions in the services list.</p><p>But we&rsquo;re going to go to virtual machines. So under the menu, I just found virtual machines and we&rsquo;re going to create a couple of virtual machines here and get them to talk to each other. So the first thing I&rsquo;m going to do is I want to create an Azure virtual machine. All right, so we&rsquo;ve got a virtual machine. I can use my Azure for students. I can create a resource group. I&rsquo;m going to use the CIS 527 resource group that I created earlier. You can create new resource groups as you want. I&rsquo;m going to call this Windows Server 2022 video, just so I know which one this is. We&rsquo;re going to create it in the US East region in whatever availability zone is available. I&rsquo;m just going to create it in Zone 1. One thing I need to do is remember that all of my VMs need to be created in the same zone, so I&rsquo;m using US East Zone 1. Then I can choose my image. There are a few different images that you can choose from. I&rsquo;ve done this before, so I have these in the recently used. For the Windows Server, I&rsquo;m going to look for Windows Server 2022 Data Center Azure Edition. What you don&rsquo;t want is the core. If you look there is an Azure Edition, there are also some Azure Edition core options.</p><p>If I look at Windows Server here, you&rsquo;ll see that there are a lot of different Windows Server images out there. You&rsquo;ll need to look at all these different versions. What you want is the Azure Edition without the core. You can look through tons and tons and tons of these. But as I showed on that previous machine, I want Windows Server 2022 Data Center Azure Edition, and I want it without the core. I want Small Disk, Windows Server 2022. Looks like there are tons and tons and tons of these. Azure Edition Core, Azure Edition Core, Azure Edition. There we go. Windows Server 2022 Data Center Azure Edition. I&rsquo;m just going to grab one of these. I&rsquo;m going to grab that one. You can see that that&rsquo;s the one that I had previously, Azure Edition X64 Gen2. We&rsquo;re going to run it on X64. We can run it with Azure Spot Discount, which is a discounted rate. I&rsquo;m not going to turn that on right now.</p><p>We&rsquo;re going to run this on a standard B1A. this CPU, you can run it with more memory and actually if you can, I recommend doing it. There are a lot of different ones available but I&rsquo;m gonna just try and run this on a standard B1S. So we&rsquo;re gonna hit review and create. Let&rsquo;s see, basics. Oh yes, I need to go back here to the basics and I need to set a password. So I&rsquo;m going to use CS5 .27 as my username and then I&rsquo;m going to use this generated password as a default password. I have it off screen in a notepad just so I remember that password and I&rsquo;m gonna make sure that I enable the remote desktop port so that I have that available. So now we&rsquo;re gonna go to review and create. It&rsquo;s going to create this, it&rsquo;s going to set up my subscription credits. So I&rsquo;m gonna hit create and this will actually create my virtual machine. This process may take a little bit so you&rsquo;ll see up here, it&rsquo;s submitting the deployment. and it&rsquo;s doing the deployment in progress. And so it will take a little bit to run this deployment. And then once it&rsquo;s done, I&rsquo;ll show you how to connect to that virtual machine.</p><p>OK, so that took about a minute or so to complete. So once the deployment is complete, I can click this option to say Go to Resource. There are also some things that I can do such as set up auto shutdown. So I&rsquo;m going to click on that real quick and go to this auto shutdown. You can enable it to shut down on an automated schedule just in case you don&rsquo;t forget. This helps you conserve resources. Basically, if you&rsquo;re not using your VM, you should shut it down so that you&rsquo;re not using up any of your resources. I&rsquo;m not going to set this up right now, but it&rsquo;s something to keep in mind that you can do. So I&rsquo;m going to go to this back here, and then I&rsquo;m going to click Go to Resource. And this will take me to the overview of the resource. So some of the things that you&rsquo;ll notice is it&rsquo;s booting up right now. So it says the virtual machine agent status is not ready, probably because the VM&rsquo;s not fully booted yet. So that&rsquo;s okay. We&rsquo;re not going to worry about that too much right now. Instead, we&rsquo;re going to try and connect to this system. And so we can either hit Connect or Connect via Bastion. I&rsquo;m just going to connect to the system. And so it&rsquo;s going to show me what the public IP address is of the system, the username and the port, and it will let me download the native RDP. They also have some other different things you can do, such as going through a Bastion, a serial portal, an admin center. There are lots of different ways you can do it. I&rsquo;m going to play around with just the native RDP, which is really the thing that is easiest to use. So I&rsquo;m going to click this to download the RDP file, which downloads this remote desktop profile. And then if I open this file, it&rsquo;s actually going to open up the remote desktop viewer on my system. And so I&rsquo;m going to switch my window capture to grab that.</p><p>Okay, so once I download that RDP file and open it up, it will eventually come up and ask me for my credentials to&mldr; connect to that system, it has my username prefilled. I&rsquo;m just gonna type in my password and check mark, remember me and hit okay. And then it will pop up and ask me if I want to connect to that system. So eventually it will configure that remote session and we&rsquo;ll see here that it will pop up and I&rsquo;m gonna make this a little bit smaller so that we can see what&rsquo;s going on. And let me actually try and window capture that. All right, so our virtual machine is loading right now.</p><p>Okay, so I tried to connect to this virtual machine but it&rsquo;s been giving me a lot of issues and I think it has to do with the fact that it only has one virtual CPU and one gigabyte of memory. So we&rsquo;re gonna go ahead and scale up the Windows server just so that we have a little bit more access to this. So I&rsquo;m going to click the stop button to stop this virtual machine and then we&rsquo;re going to rescale it. So to do that, I need to wait for this stopping virtual machine. So this will take maybe a minute or so for it to stop. and then we will go through and rescale it. Okay. So once the virtual machine has stopped, then I&rsquo;m going to go down here on the side, and I&rsquo;m going to scroll down to find availability and scale, and then look at the size option. So there are a lot of different sizes that we can use. Currently, we&rsquo;re using B1S, which is free services eligible. I&rsquo;m going to change this to one of the other options. So you&rsquo;ll notice that these prices go up very, very quickly. And so generally, the B series is the best series for what you want to use. And so they&rsquo;ve got some of these different sizes, but you&rsquo;ll notice that they get very, very pricey very quickly. So I&rsquo;m going to choose the next one up, which is the B2S. So I&rsquo;m going to resize it to a B2S. This is going to be a little higher. It&rsquo;s going to take up some of your actual Azure credits, but as long as you&rsquo;re not running your virtual machines for too long, you won&rsquo;t use up your credits very quickly. Like that showed, it will use up $36 a month if you run it continuously for a full month. So you shouldn&rsquo;t need to run it too long. So I&rsquo;ve resized this up to a B2S, which gives me a little bit more size. So now if I refresh that page, it should bring up the correct size for the system now. Yeah, standard B2S, two virtual CPUs, four gigabytes of memory.</p><p>So now let&rsquo;s start this up and see if we can connect to it. So we&rsquo;re going to let it start. And then once it&rsquo;s done starting, we&rsquo;re going to go to the Connect tab and we&rsquo;re going to download that RDP file again and connect to it through that. All right, so finally I&rsquo;ve got connected to this. So I now have my virtual machine running here on remote desktop, and I can manage everything just as if I&rsquo;m working locally on that machine. It should be pretty performant when you&rsquo;re running it on a B2S system. So for example, here I can go to Computer Management. I can see all the computer management tools. I can see the server manager dashboard, and I should have full admin access to this version. virtual machine to do whatever I want. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m recording this on an ultra wide monitor and it defaults to full screen. So you&rsquo;ll notice that I have a lot of screen space and you can&rsquo;t really see what&rsquo;s going on here. But from here, you should be able to follow along with everything you need to do in this virtual machine in order to actually set up a Windows Active Directory.</p><p>So the other thing that I&rsquo;m going to show you real quick on the system is PowerShell. So I&rsquo;m just going to in this search box here, I&rsquo;m gonna load up PowerShell real quick. And then what I&rsquo;m going to do is zoom in a little bit so we can see what&rsquo;s going on here in PowerShell. So in PowerShell, I&rsquo;m going to check the IP config and we&rsquo;ll see that we have this adapter right here that is set to 10 .0 .0 .4. And we&rsquo;ll need to remember that because that&rsquo;s the IP address of the internal network that we&rsquo;re working on. This 172 .178 .112 .59, the external address that it gave us is different than the internal IP address that we have. in our network in Azure, and we&rsquo;ll look at that in just a second. So I&rsquo;m going to leave this running, I&rsquo;m going to leave this connected, but I&rsquo;m going to switch back to Chrome and we&rsquo;re going to create another system real quick.</p><p>All right, so back here in Chrome, I&rsquo;m going to go back to my Azure services, I&rsquo;m going to go to my virtual machines, and we&rsquo;re going to create another Azure virtual machine. And so this one, again, I&rsquo;m going to add to my CS5 .27 resource group. This, I&rsquo;m going to call it Windows 11 video. I&rsquo;m going to put it in the same availability zone. I&rsquo;m going to create it using the Windows 11 Pro VM, X64. I&rsquo;m also going to run this on a B2S just to give us a little bit more power. This one should run okay on a B1S, but I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and upgrade it to a B2S just to have that extra power to make this work a little bit easier. So we&rsquo;re going to run it on a B2S. We&rsquo;re going to set up a username and I&rsquo;m going to use a different password for this. So I&rsquo;ve got my password already set up there, allow remote desktop. And then we&rsquo;re going to confirm that we have an eligible license with multi -tenant hosting rights. We do because we&rsquo;re working through the student licenses that we have. So we&rsquo;re going to confirm that we have that. So now we&rsquo;re going to hit review and create and it&rsquo;s going to create this virtual machine for us. So we&rsquo;ll let it create this. And then same as before, once it gets created and deployed, we&rsquo;re going to download that remote desktop file and open it up on remote desktop so we can see what&rsquo;s going on. And I&rsquo;ll come back to this video as soon as this is done deploying.</p><p>Okay, so once again, this resource is now deployed. I&rsquo;m going to click go to resource. It&rsquo;s still booting up. So you may not get a little error here, but I&rsquo;m just going to go to connect. I&rsquo;m going to download the RDP file. And then I&rsquo;m going to open that RDP file. It will&mldr; will pop up and prompt me to connect to that system. You won&rsquo;t be able to see this because I can&rsquo;t window capture it because it&rsquo;s a protected window. But as soon as this comes up, I will switch over and show you that connection and show that the two systems can talk to each other. Okay, so after a couple of minutes, this machine comes up. I have to click through some of the initial setup process on Windows 11, just like any other machine. But now I am here on my remote desktop looking at my Windows 11 machine. I&rsquo;ve got PowerShell opened up. So I&rsquo;m gonna make that a little bit bigger so that we can see what&rsquo;s going on here with that window. And once again, I&rsquo;m just gonna type in IP config. And you&rsquo;ll notice this is assigned the IP address 10 .0 .0 .5. And so that tells me what its IP address is on the internal network that these other systems can talk to. And so if I try and ping 10 .0 .0 .4, I should probably not get a response because Windows server has a firewall on it. But those two are both actually in the same network and they should be able to respond. Let me actually jump to Windows Server real quick and check the firewall and see if I can ping the other way around.</p><p>Okay, so for testing this, I went into the Windows firewall and I found the options for core networking diagnostics, ICMP echo request, and I enabled those on domain and private networks so that we can actually receive a ping from the systems. And so now if I switch back to my Windows Server, if I go here to Windows Server, I can now ping that IP address of 0 .0 .5, which is the Windows 11, and I received that ping response back. So we&rsquo;re actually able to talk to each other. This is really important to know when you&rsquo;re setting up your Active Directory. Basically your server is going to have one IP address and you won&rsquo;t be able to set a static IP address on it. You&rsquo;ll just leave the IP address alone. And then on your Windows client, you&rsquo;ll know the address is 10 .0 .0 .5 or something similar. And you&rsquo;ll have to set up a host file entry for this. I&rsquo;ll kind of talk anybody through that that has any questions. But this is the basic idea for setting up virtual machines in Azure. You can also go through the same process to set up an Ubuntu virtual machine. It&rsquo;s basically the same process as anything else. So if you have any questions or any issues with that, let me know. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m happy to help. So feel free to ask any questions you have.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></section></div></main></div><script src=/cis527/js/clipboard/clipboard.min.js?1761055826 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/perfect-scrollbar/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1761055826 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/theme.min.js?1761055826 defer></script></div><script src=/cis527/js/tele-scroll.min.js?1761055826 defer></script></body></html>
