Welcome to CIS 527 - Enterprise System Administration.

My name is Russell Feldhausen, and I'll be your instructor for this course. My contact information is shown here, and is also listed on the syllabus, and on the home page of the course on K-State Online. My email address is russfeld@ksu.edu, and it is by far my preferred method of communication since it allows me to have a record of our conversations and respond when I'm available.

I'll also be on the K-State CS Slack team, so you can easily chat with me there.

As you may know, I am working remotely out of my home in Kansas City, so I won't be available on campus very often. I do have an office, and I will be there from time to time to meet with folks on campus and hold office hours. I'll be sure to announce those times as they are scheduled.

In addition, I must give credit to several people for helping me develop the content in this course. First and foremost is [Seth Galitzer](http://people.cs.ksu.edu/~sgsax/), the CS system administrator, as well as several of my former students and teaching assistants.

For a brief overview of the course, there are 7 lab modules, plus a final project, that you'll be responsible for completing. The modules are configured in K-State Online as gated modules, meaning that you must complete each item in the module in order before continuing. However, you can move at your own pace, and go as fast or as slow as you'd like. When you are ready to have a lab graded, you'll schedule a time to meet interactively with me either in person or remotely. Finally, all work in this course must be completed and all labs graded by no later than December 14th, 2018.

Looking ahead to the rest of this first module, you'll see that there are a few more items to be completed before you can move on. In the next video, I'll discuss a bit more information about navigating through this course on Canvas and using the videos posted on ~~Mediasite~~ YouTube.

One thing I highly encourage each of you to do is read the syllabus for this course in its entirety, and let me know if you have any questions. My view is that the syllabus is a contact between me as your teacher and you as a student, defining how each of us should treat each other and what we should expect from each other. I have made a few changes to my standard syllabus template for this course, and those changes are clearly highlighted. Finally, the syllabus itself is subject to change as needed as we adapt to this new course layout and format, and all changes will be clearly communicated to everyone before they take effect.

The grading in this course is very simple. Each of the 7 lab assignments will be worth 10% of your grade, for a total of 70%. Likewise, each quiz is 1% for a total of 15%. Finally, the final project is worth 15% of your grade. There will be some extra credit points available, mainly through the **Bug Bounty** assignment, which you will review as part of this module. Lastly, the standard "90-80-70-60" grading scale will apply, though I reserve the right to curve grades up to a higher grade level at my discretion. Therefore, you will never be required to get higher than 90% for an A, but you may get an A if you score slightly below 90% if I choose to curve the grades.

Since this is a completely online, self-paced course, you may be asking yourself what is different about this course. First off, there are no due dates! You can work at your own pace, and turn in work whenever you like. However, as discussed before, you must do all the readings and assignments in order before moving on, so you cannot jump ahead. Because of that, there is no established policy for late work. The only deadline is **December 14th, 2018**, where all work must be submitted and all labs graded before that deadline.

In addition, due to the flexible online format of this class, there won't be any long lecture videos to watch. Instead, each module will consist of several short videos, each focused on a particular topic or task. Likewise, there won't be any textbooks formally used, but you'll be directed to a bevy of online resources for additional information.

What hasn't changed, though, is the basic concept of a college course. You'll still be expected to watch or read about 6 hours of content to complete each module. In addition to that, each lab assignment may require anywhere from 1 to 6 hours of work to complete. If you plan on doing a module every two weeks, that roughly equates to 3 hours of content and 3 hours of homework each week, which is the expected workload from a 3 credit hour college course.

Also, while some of the quizzes will be graded automatically, much of the grading will still be done directly by me. This includes the lab assignments. For each lab assignment, you'll schedule a time to meet with me either in person or remotely to review your work for that lab. Finally, I'll still have regular office hours, to be held either on campus or virtually online. Of course, you can always email me or chat with me on Slack if you have any questions. In fact, since I work from home, I'll probably be easier to contact than some of my fellow faculty!

For this class, each student is required to have access to a personal computer. It should have plenty of RAM and CPU power to host several virtual machines concurrently. In addition, you'll need some virtual machine software, which is available for free to K-State CS students. I'll discuss how to acquire and install that software in the first lab module. Finally, you'll also need access to a high-speed connection. The wireless network on campus will generally suffice. If you have any concerns about meeting these requirements, please contact me ASAP! We may have options available through some on-campus resources to help you out.

Finally, as you are aware, this course is always subject to change. This is the first time this course has been taught online and self-paced, so there may be a few hiccups as we get started. The best advice I have is to look upon this graphic with the words "Don't Panic" written in large, friendly letters, and remember that it'll all work out in the end as long as you know where your towel is.

So, to complete this module, there are a few other things that you'll need to do. The next step is to watch the video on navigating Canvas and using the ~~Mediasite~~ YouTube videos, which will give you a good idea of how to most effectively work through the content in this course.
