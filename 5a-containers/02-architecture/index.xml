To use a traditional virtual machine, we first install a hypervisor that allows us to run multiple VMs on a single system. That hypervisor may be installed directly on the hardware, as it is in most enterprise settings, or we may install the hypervisor on top of an existing operating system, like we’ve done with VMWare on our own computers. Then, inside of the virtual machine, we install another entire operating system, as well as any of the software we need to run our applications. If we want to have multiple VMs that all run the same operating system, we’ll have to install a full copy of that operating system in each VM, in addition to the operating system that may be installed outside of our hypervisor. Can you spot a possible problem here?</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5a-containers/02-architecture/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
