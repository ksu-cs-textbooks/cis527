#### Video Notes

{{% notice note %}}

_Instead of creating and recording my own video overview of Kubernetes, I decided it would be best to just include an existing video that does an excellent job of covering that topic. My video would have been very similar, but probably with fewer graphics and a bit more condensed._

_I encourage you to watch the video above through at least the "Kubernetes Architecture" portion (around 35 minutes) to get a good feel for how Kubernetes builds upon what we've done in Docker and Docker Compose. If you want to get some hands-on experience with Kubernetes, you can continue in the video to the tutorial using Minikube._

_If you know of a better introduction to Kubernetes video that you think would fit here, feel free to let me know. I may consider including it in a future semester._

_You aren't required to use Kubernetes for any of the labs in this course, but if you are comfortable with it you are welcome to give it a try. That said, if you need help debugging it beyond my skill, I may ask you to switch back to Docker and Docker Compose instead of pushing ahead with Kubernetes. --Russ_
