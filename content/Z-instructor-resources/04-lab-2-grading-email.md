#### Greetings!

Here is the information you'll need to know to get your lab graded.


1. **Submit Files:** Submit your Puppet Manifest Files via Canvas. I will download them and test them on my system for grading.
1. **Grading Date/Time:** \<time\> <br> Contact me ASAP if that time will not work for you for any reason and I will work with you to reschedule.
1. **Zoom Link:** \<link\> <br> If you haven't used Zoom before, I recommend going to https://ksu.zoom.us/ first to download the Zoom client software. Then, when the time comes, click the link above to join the Zoom session.
1. **Your Setup:** <br> Before you join the Zoom session for grading, please have the following steps completed on your end. This helps things go as smoothly as possible:
  1. Use the fastest internet connection available to you. If you are using a laptop with a wireless connection, you may want to plug in to a hard-wired connection if available. If you can work from campus, that may be best, depending on your home internet connection.
  1. Make sure your audio input device (microphone) is working in Zoom. You are not required to have a webcam, but you are welcome to use one if you like. I will be using a webcam and microphone on my end.
1. **Finality** <br> Once you begin the grading process, no changes may be made to your system to fix any errors encountered. The grade you receive will reflect the state of your VMs at the start of the grading process. This is to ensure that grades are fairly determined and that no special consideration is given.

That should cover everything. Please let me know if you have any questions prior to your scheduled grading time.

_Good luck!_<br>
