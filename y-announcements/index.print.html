<p>Hello, and welcome to the week one announcements for CIS 527 and CC 510. In Fall 2023, my name is Russ Feldhausen. I&rsquo;ll be your instructor for this semester, my contact information can be found here. It&rsquo;s also on the syllabus. It&rsquo;s also on the cannabis page. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns at all in this class. I also have one teaching assistant this semester, Matt Schwartz, Matt is going to be working with me to help you if you have any questions on the labs, he&rsquo;s also going to be helping me with doing some of the grading Matt did this class last year, I believe. So he&rsquo;s pretty familiar with a lot of the content. And he&rsquo;s going to be working right alongside you to check all the labs for me. So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to either of us, we&rsquo;re happy to help. In this course, just like a lot of courses, it&rsquo;s built with gated modules on canvas. There&rsquo;s one module due every other week in this class, so please check the due dates very carefully. Each module includes a lab assignment, that lab assignment requires a live grading portion, which means you&rsquo;ll work with either Matt or myself via zoom, so that we can grade your work, it means that this is a very labor intensive class. So please be aware of that. We&rsquo;re also going to have some discussions throughout the semester. So you&rsquo;ll either have a recorded video to watch, or I&rsquo;ll bring in a guest speaker and you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to join a live zoom and speak with one of our guest speakers. And then finally, at the end of the semester, we&rsquo;ll have a final project.</p>
<p>So for discussion of this course, I&rsquo;ve set up a channel on the CIS Discord server. So I please encourage you to use discord. One of the early assignments is to go to discord and introduce yourself there so that you can find the channel and make sure you&rsquo;re in the right place. So please make sure you do that. If you have any questions, personal issues, grading questions, etc. I&rsquo;ve set up a help email for this class, which is cis527-help. If you&rsquo;re in any of the case, Dave email systems, if you just type CIS 527 Dash, it should autocomplete email is kind of our official method for communication in this class, Discord is a little bit more flexible. In general, feel free to ask questions on Discord. But if it&rsquo;s personal stuff, grading stuff, feel free to put that in an email, that cis 527 Help email goes to both Matt and I and whoever is the first one available, we&rsquo;ll answer that for you as best we can. So success in this course, learning to be a system administrator is difficult. And it is a different way of thinking compared to a lot of the programming that you&rsquo;ve done. Because there&rsquo;s simultaneously one way to do things. And there&rsquo;s also many way to do things in a lot of ways. So to be successful in this course, you really need to come at it with a growth mindset, it&rsquo;s going to be tricky, you&rsquo;re going to break stuff, you&rsquo;re going to run into issues. And so you have to be willing to sit down and try and learn. But I guarantee you, you can learn how to do any of this if you just take the time to do it. The second big thing about being a successful sysadmin is don&rsquo;t just read or watch content, but engage with it. There&rsquo;s a lot of content where I&rsquo;m just going to sit there and go line by line through a config file, or I&rsquo;m going to discuss some concepts. And if you just read the video, read the text or watch the video and just go oh yeah, I got it. That may not be enough, you may really need to engage with it and follow along and do those examples yourself. So to really see and understand how it&rsquo;s working. A lot of these labs involve multiple parts. So please work iteratively get one part working, make sure it&rsquo;s working, then move on to the next part. One of the most frustrating things in this class is when somebody brings me a lab, it&rsquo;s like, oh, yeah, I tried to do this and it didn&rsquo;t work. So then I tried to do this and it didn&rsquo;t work. And so then I tried to do this and it didn&rsquo;t work. And so they&rsquo;ve got like three or four broken things in their lab instead of just one that they can focus on. And it&rsquo;s hard to tell where the error is. The other nice thing is we&rsquo;re using VMware for all of this. So VMware has a very nice snapshot feature. So just like any other class, save early and save often make yourself snapshots. Anytime you get something working, I always hate that situation where a student breaks a VM. And then they don&rsquo;t have any snapshots. And they have to start over. And it happens every semester. And I will guarantee it will happen this semester. So make sure you&rsquo;re making snapshots early and often and using them all the time. It&rsquo;s just like playing a video game, you&rsquo;re walking into a boss fight, auto save before you going to the boss fight. The same thing happens in this course. Finally, don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help. There are always situations in this course where something will not work, right or you will do something and it doesn&rsquo;t work the same on your computer as it does on every other every other computer. Don&rsquo;t assume that you&rsquo;re stupid or that you&rsquo;re having trouble. Please ask for help. It is very easy in this course to back yourself into a corner. And almost every semester there&rsquo;s a student that has something happened on their system that even I can&rsquo;t debug. And so don&rsquo;t sit there and just spin your wheels. If you get stuck and you&rsquo;re not making progress, ask for help. Let us know Matt and I are here to help. So don&rsquo;t be afraid to reach out and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>So like I talked about the lab grading this course there are seven labs. Most of them are graded interactively. I think there are two labs that we submit everything online. For the interactive grading, what you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;ll schedule a grading time via Calendly, we recommend choosing a 15 or 20 minute time slot, please, for my own sanity, please check the TA schedule first, Matt gets paid to do this hourly. So the more times that he can grade stuff, the more money he makes. So please feel free to check that schedule first and see if you can get on his schedule. If not feel free to get on my schedule, you can schedule your lab time before you&rsquo;re done with the lab. But the lab grading must happen before the due date. I think most of the labs are due on Friday. And so you should schedule your lab grading time before Friday at 5pm. There are 25 of you in this class, which means if we do for an hour, that still takes six hours, at least, to grade everything. So that&rsquo;s like I said, it&rsquo;s very labor intensive to do this class. So please be aware, you may not get that early time if you don&rsquo;t schedule ahead. The other thing is my Calendly, especially requires anywhere from two to four hours notice. So if you get done with the lab at four o&rsquo;clock on Friday and want to try and find a grading time between four o&rsquo;clock and five o&rsquo;clock on Friday, it&rsquo;s not going to be there. So please be aware of that schedule your grading times in advance. You when we do grading, we&rsquo;ll bring it up on Zoom, we&rsquo;ll have you share your screen pointed at VMware, we will ask you to walk through things in your VMs and show us that it&rsquo;s working correctly, we may ask you to run commands, we may ask you to show us config files, we may ask you to do certain things. That&rsquo;s our way of confirming issues, your systems work the way they should. The last thing, once you start grading, you cannot make a change. For example, if you pull up a config file and realize that something is wrong, it&rsquo;s too late, you can&rsquo;t make that change. So please make sure that you have everything done before you do any grading. Because once you start that grading process, it is the way it is. And we have to take it as you submit it. We try and be pretty lenient with partial credit, but do your own testing, make sure things are working before you go for lab grading.</p>
<p>So this year, one of the things I want to do, again, is discussions a couple years ago, I brought in some guest speakers. Now I&rsquo;ve got a big class this semester, I think it&rsquo;d be fun to do that again. So I&rsquo;ve got a survey, it&rsquo;s on the first page of the discussions module, it&rsquo;s a little when to meet survey, please respond to that survey by Friday, August 25. I&rsquo;m going to take the most common overlap time or maybe one or two of those and make those into zoom discussion times. On most weeks, I&rsquo;ll just have them zoom office hours, but a few times throughout the semester, I will try and bring in some guest speakers. In years past I had Seth Galitzer, I got K-State&rsquo;s CIO, Kyle Hutson to talk about supercomputers. I&rsquo;ve had a couple of folks from industry that have come in. So it&rsquo;s a really great chance to learn more about being a system administrator, and all the different ways that that looks out in the real world. And so part of your grade will come from participating in those discussions, you&rsquo;ll submit some questions beforehand that I can pick from, and then you&rsquo;ll either participate in the live discussion on Zoom, or you&rsquo;ll watch the video and write a response afterwards. But it&rsquo;s a really good way to learn more about system administration in the field itself. So I think this is a really fun part of this class. So that&rsquo;s really all I&rsquo;ve got for this first week of announcements. As always, if you have any questions, join the discussion on Discord. I&rsquo;ll be looking forward to seeing your announcements, your introduction posts there, and I&rsquo;ll be pretty active on Discord throughout the semester. I also host Tea Time office hours, which are Mondays at 11 o&rsquo;clock this year, you&rsquo;ll see some information being posted about that shortly. The Tea Time officers are available on campus in person, but they&rsquo;re also held on zoom so you can join either way. And then of course, both Matt and I will have some one on one office hours available via Calendly. So you can schedule some time there. But again, bear in mind, there&rsquo;s 25 of you in this class. It&rsquo;s a very labor intensive class. So please be mindful and try and do the best you can working with us on Discord and some other things. And then schedule the office hours if you need that time to work with us directly. Because we&rsquo;re going to be really overloaded trying to keep up with 25 students in this class. So that&rsquo;s all I got for this semester. I&rsquo;m rooting for you. Good luck. I hope everything goes well. You&rsquo;ll probably see me every other week. Usually since this is an every other week class. I usually post announcement videos every other week. So watch for an announcement video probably the day after Labor Day this year. If you have any questions or concerns, let us know otherwise, I look forward to interacting with you on Discord and I will see you in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to the week two announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 510 in Fall 2023. I&rsquo;ll try and post announcements videos like this about every other week in this class. Usually these announcements videos are pretty informal, so you&rsquo;ll notice I don&rsquo;t have my background set up or anything, but it&rsquo;s just a chance for me to talk through some things that are on my mind, things that I would normally announce at the beginning of class if we were meeting in person. But instead, I think it&rsquo;s much easier to do these quick videos is.</p>
<p>So first things first, you should be working on lab one and you should be hopefully getting to the point where you&rsquo;re about ready to get it graded. So what you&rsquo;ll need to do to get your labs graded is you&rsquo;ll need to schedule a time slot to meet with either Matt or myself. My preference is that you check Matt&rsquo;s schedule first. The only reason I say that is because there are 26 of you and there&rsquo;s only one of me, and I&rsquo;m currently teaching three classes officially and three classes unofficially. So my schedule is very packed this semester and so I&rsquo;m really relying on Matt to cover a lot of the grading load, but I&rsquo;m available as well. So please schedule a time slot. Check matt&rsquo;s calendar first. If Matt&rsquo;s times don&rsquo;t work for you, then check my calendar and pick a time with me. When you&rsquo;re ready to get graded. Make sure you make snapshots in VMware so that you can roll back to those snapshots if anything breaks. And then when it&rsquo;s time for grading, please have everything ready. That means have your VMs open, have them up and running. Have files open, whatever we ask you to do so that it goes really quickly. And then just be prepared to demonstrate your work for this first lab. We&rsquo;re going to ask you to show us a few settings on each of your systems. And we&rsquo;re going to ask you to run a couple of terminal commands that will show all the file permissions for the docs folders that you made. So be prepared to do some of that. Typically, lab grading only takes about ten minutes per lab if everything thing is working correctly. However, if things are not working correctly, it can take much longer as we try and diagnose problems and look for partial credit. Um. When we&rsquo;re doing lab grading, we may not work with you long enough to fix those problems. You may want to schedule a follow up time to get some problems fixed, especially in labs three and four where those labs build on each other. This first lab, don&rsquo;t worry about it. We&rsquo;re going to delete these VMs as soon as we&rsquo;re done with them, so don&rsquo;t worry too much about it. This is just an introductory lab, but be aware that that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re doing with the lab grading, so let us know if you have any questions on that. But don&rsquo;t be afraid to schedule your time slot. And to be clear, you can schedule your time slot now, as long as that time slot happens after you get the lab done. So if you want to get graded next Wednesday when it&rsquo;s due, I believe it&rsquo;s Tuesday or Wednesday when it&rsquo;s due, go ahead and schedule the time slot that works for you. It&rsquo;ll be on our calendars. And then make sure you have the lab done before that time slot. Do not wait until the due date to try and schedule your time slot because A, most of them will be full, and B, most, I believe Matt&rsquo;s calendar does. And I know my calendar requires anywhere from two to 4 hours prior notice to schedule a time. So be aware of that.</p>
<p>The other thing that I&rsquo;ve done is I&rsquo;ve scheduled our weekly discussion times for Thursdays from one to 02:00 p.m.. That was the time slot that worked best for most people in this class and also fits my schedule. So what we&rsquo;ll be doing with that is I&rsquo;m going to reach out to a few friends of mine and try and get a few guest speakers to come in during those discussion times to tell you about their jobs in it and what they do. So I&rsquo;ll be posting a schedule for that very soon. Some of these will be repeats from previous semesters, but I&rsquo;m also going to try and get a couple of new people if I can find some, so be aware of that. So to earn points for the discussions, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are five graded discussions throughout the semester. What you&rsquo;ll do is you&rsquo;ll submit two questions before the scheduled discussion time. So I will be updating those and posting those as soon as I get the schedule figured out. Then you can either attend the live discussion with our guest speaker Thursday from one to 02:00 P.m. That week. Or if you&rsquo;re not available, you can watch the video afterwards. Either one. To earn points. If you attend live and participate by asking a question, you&rsquo;ll get points. If you attend live and don&rsquo;t ask a question or you watch a video, there will be a short response that I will have you write afterwards. So you don&rsquo;t have to participate if you don&rsquo;t want to. There are ways to earn points either way, and then for weeks where we don&rsquo;t have a scheduled guest speaker, I will just use those times as office hours. Matt may also be available during those times, so I will hop in the Zoom session. If you have questions, join us and ask us any questions you have. If nobody shows up after about ten or 15 minutes, I will tend to drop out of the Zoom session. But those are kind of our open office hours times. If you have any questions for us on days that are not scheduled for a guest speaker.</p>
<p>The other big thing in this class if you need any help, there are a couple of different ways I recommend getting help. First and foremost, there&rsquo;s the CIS 527 help email address that is posted on the Canvas website. That address goes to myself and Matt, so we can both answer those questions very quickly. We&rsquo;ve also set up an Ed discussion board for this course that you can find on Canvas linked on the side. Ed Discussion is a great place to get questions answered in this class because it&rsquo;s got a lot of features where we can post code and snippets and things like that. And any of your questions you post can be seen by others in the class. So it&rsquo;s a great way where we only have to answer a question once, especially if it&rsquo;s a popular question and someone&rsquo;s confused on it. If either of those don&rsquo;t work, you can also schedule a time via calendar with either myself or Matt to get some one on one help. And then of course, you&rsquo;re also welcome to attend the office hours on Thursdays if we&rsquo;re not having a guest speaker that week. So that&rsquo;s all the real updates that I&rsquo;ve got for this week. Hopefully things are going well with the first lab up. Hopefully by now you&rsquo;ve gotten access to VMware and you&rsquo;ve gotten access to the Microsoft Store so you can get VMware installed, get Windows installed. If you haven&rsquo;t done that, I recommend doing that now. If you have any issues with that, let us know. It may take us a day or so to go through the process to get that fixed. So again, do not wait until the last minute to start on these labs. We really want you to be successful, and that means starting early. So, as always, if you have any questions, let us know. Otherwise, I will probably post another video next week. Good luck.</p>
