      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week three announcements video for CC 510 in Fall 2021. So this week you should be wrapping up lab one. If you need graded, feel free to go ahead and schedule a time on my calendar for today. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got everybody covered at this point, but just checking to make sure. That will cover the first lab.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the announcements video for CC 510 in Fall 2021, I&amp;rsquo;m coming to you today from the CS video studio here on campus. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do that a couple more times this semester. But that&amp;rsquo;s probably why things look a little bit different today than your normal announcements video. So this week, you should be working on lab two, which is due tonight by 11:59pm.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello and welcome to the week nine announcements video for CC 510 in Fall 2021. So you&amp;rsquo;re working on lab five, right now I was able to get lab four graded for everybody. And it looks like that went well. Lab five is where we pivot into the cloud, which we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about in just a second. And then also don&amp;rsquo;t forget, every other week, you&amp;rsquo;ve got a discussion response due so if you haven&amp;rsquo;t done that yet, go watch the video from the previous semesters, discussions, and then write up your short response.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week 12 Announcements video for CC 510 in fall 2021. So coming up this week, you&amp;rsquo;ve got lab six, that&amp;rsquo;s due a Monday. So about six days from now at 7pm, you should hopefully be working on that right now. And then after that most of the deadlines move to December where you have December 3, your final project proposal is due; December 6, we have lab seven that is due and then you have until the end of finals week on December 17, to actually present your final project to me, so there&amp;rsquo;s not a whole lot left in this class.</description>
