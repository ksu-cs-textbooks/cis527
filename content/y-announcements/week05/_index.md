Hello and welcome to the week five announcements video for CIS 527 and CC510 in fall 2025. So this week you should be working on lab 2, which is due this Wednesday. We'll talk about lab 2 in just a second, but remember that's due tomorrow. Next Tuesday, we're going to have our first discussion, so make sure you're planning ahead for that. Next Wednesday is going to be the lab 3 quizzes, and in two weeks, we're going to have lab 3 due and also our second discussion as well. 

So for lab two grading, remember you're working on two puppet manifest files. So make sure you're getting those done. Lab two grading is Canvas only. You just submit your manifest files on Canvas and Josh and I will grade them offline. You don't have to schedule a meeting with us or anything. We will just take care of that. What we're going to do is for everybody that is submitted lab to by the deadline, I will go in shortly after the deadline and put in a temporary grade of one point for everybody. That will unlock module three so you can start working. But I'm only going to do that for people that have submitted lab two. Once I do that, that will give you access to the lab two model solutions. And so I want to make sure I only unlock the module for people who have submitted a lab. If you have questions or concerns about that, email the help email and we will help you get access to the things you need. 

So next Tuesday, remember our first speaker is going to be Seth Gallitzer. Seth is the engineering IT manager and formerly our computer science sysadmin. It's also a K-State computer science grad. So Seth really knows a lot about what he's doing and working in IT and system administration. So he's going to be coming in next Tuesday, a week from today at 2.30 p.m. via Zoom. The Zoom link and everything is on Canvas. Remember to get points for this, you have to do two things. You have to ask a couple of questions before 2.30. So fill out that assignment. And then to get attendance points, you either have to attend the session and ask a question, or you can watch the video afterward and write a quick response to the prompts that I give there. Either one of those is a great way to participate, but I really hope you'll consider joining us and listening to what Seth has to say about his experience in system administration. 

So then we're going to start working on Lab 3. Lab 3 is where we introduce core networking services. And so in Lab 3, you're going to set up some IP addresses for your systems. You're going to install a DNS and DHCP server on Linux. You're going to install an SNMP server on Linux and play around with that. You're also going to play around with Wireshark a little bit. There's a lot of technical detail going on in Lab 3, and a lot of this is going to be new for you. So I encourage you to take a look at the hints and diagrams in Lab 3, especially in the textbook. There are some diagrams. There is a video showing a working solution. There's lots of cool stuff going on. So take care with Lab 3. Lab 3 is one of the harder labs in this class, especially if you have no experience with networking. And don't be afraid to ask questions or come to office hours and get help. We are happy to help you out with that. 

Other than that, hopefully things are going well this semester. You can always keep in touch on Ed Discussion. There will be a mega thread for Lab 3 posted very soon. I'm always available on Discord and Teams. I still host tea time office hours every Monday morning at 10 a.m. You can join on Zoom or in person, and you can always schedule one-on-one office hours with me. So hopefully that works out. So now we're on to lab three where we're going to get started networking. Hopefully you enjoy that. For anybody watching this video, I'm trying some new mic settings. So hopefully my audio sounds a little bit better. If you have any feedback on my audio for my mic, let me know. I'm still playing around with that, trying to get better sound out of my mic here. But hopefully things go well with Lab 3. If you have any questions, let us know. Otherwise, best of luck. And I will look forward to seeing you all next week.
