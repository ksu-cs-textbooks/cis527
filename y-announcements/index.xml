My name is Russell Feldhausen. I’ll be your instructor for this semester. My contact information is here on the screen. You can also find it on the Canvas homepage, on the syllabus, just about anywhere you look with this class. You can find my contact info. My email is here. My website is here. You can also find me on Teams and Discord as at russfeld. I’m pretty easy to get a hold of. One thing to be aware of, I do work remotely. I live in Kansas City, and so I’m working remotely Tuesdays through Fridays. I am on campus on Mondays. So if you want to see me in person, you can meet with me on Mondays. Usually Monday mornings is when I’m going to be available. And there is a way to schedule that that I’ll talk about here in just a minute. But just be aware of that. The rest of the week, I work remotely, which does mean I’m pretty easy to get a hold of on Teams or Discord or Ed Discussion anytime you have a question.</description></item><item><title>Fall '25 Week 2</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week02/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week02/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello and welcome to the week two announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 510 in fall 2025. So this week you should be getting started on the first lab. Please bear in mind I do have a megathread on ed discussion for this lab. So if you have any questions or concerns with this lab, I’d really recommend that you post in the ed discussion and also check there, but you can also email to do lab grading. I get a lot of questions about lab grading in this class. The way this works is you’re going to schedule a time slot to meet with either the GTA Josh or myself. You need to meet with us before the lab is due. You can schedule your time slot anytime. So even if you’re not done with the lab right now, you can schedule a time slot for next Wednesday sometime when the lab is due, but you need to have the lab done before that time slot, obviously. So you schedule a time slot. Please check Josh’s calendar first. And then if he doesn’t have any times available that works for you, then schedule with me. Please bear in mind, I am generally very busy on Mondays because I’m on campus and then a little bit on Wednesdays and Thursdays as I have lab meetings and other things going on those days. Tuesdays and Fridays are usually pretty open for me. So anyway, schedule with Josh first, then me using our calendly links, or I also have a booking link that you can use.</description></item><item><title>Fall '25 Week 3</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week03/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week03/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello and welcome to the week three announcements video for CIS 527 and CC510 in fall 2025. So this week you should be working on lab one. Lab one is due tomorrow by 7 p.m. So make sure you get that done. Basically all you need to do if you haven’t already is schedule a grading time with either Josh or myself. We will meet with you on Zoom. We will have you share your screen and walk through getting all your lab graded. Remember that every day a lab is late. It is 10% off of the total points in the class or in the project. So this lab is worth 50 points. If you get graded after Wednesday, it’s going to be worth 45 points and it goes down from there. Then next week on Wednesday, the module two quizzes are due. And then the week after that on Wednesday the 24th, Lab 2 is due. Lab two, you don’t have to schedule a grading time for. All the grading for that is done on Canvas. So unless you have questions or want to do an interactive grading, all you have to do for Lab 2 is submit your two puppet manifest files on Canvas and we’ll grade those offline. Also, our first discussion is going to be coming up soon. I’m still waiting to hear back from some of our speakers and I’ll talk about that in just a second.</description></item></channel></rss>
