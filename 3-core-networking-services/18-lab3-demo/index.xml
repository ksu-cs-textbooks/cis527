You may have to update some details such as the network IP addresses and hostnames to match the current instructions for Lab 3.
Video Transcript Okay, so I’m going to try and talk through a model solution version of lab three and give you some advice on how to go about this lab. And also how to verify that you got this lab configured and working properly. So the first thing we’re going to do is we’re going to look at our IP address. So I’m going to go to the Edit menu in VMware and then choose virtual network editor. And in the virtual network editor, we’re going to find our NAT network. And we’ll notice that it has a subnet address of 192.168.40.0, yours will probably be similar, but it may have a different third octet right here. It’s usually randomly assigned by VMware when you install it. Mine is dot 40. Yours might be different, so we need to make note of that IP address. The other thing in here we can see is this checkmark the use local DHCP service; once you get done with task four and have your DHCP server running, you’ll want to go in here and uncheck this box, you have to click this change settings button to give it admin access. But then you can uncheck this box to turn off VMware’s DHCP service, so you can use your own. So remember we have 192.168.40.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/3-core-networking-services/18-lab3-demo/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
