Hopefully you got that done and submitted along with the questions for our presenter. The final project proposal is due this Friday, so make sure you’re working on that final project proposal. It’s just a short one page that explains your project and kind of tells me you’re on the right track and can work on it for the last two weeks of the class. Lab seven is due the following Monday on the fifth, and we’ll talk about lab seven and just a bit. And then on finals week, there’s a discussion due on Monday and your final project is due on Friday of finals week. And then finally, don’t forget, there are tevals coming as well.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2022/week14/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
