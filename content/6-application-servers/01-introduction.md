#### Video Transcript

Welcome to module 6! In this module, we'll discuss the various types of servers that you may come across in a large organization. This could include file servers, web servers, application servers, database servers, and more!

In the lab assignment, you'll set up a file server on both Windows and Ubuntu, and deal with automatically providing access to those resources for your users. You'll also configure the IIS and Apache web servers, and learn about installing an application on each. Finally, we'll discuss some of the considerations for configuring a database server, and you'll work with setting up a database server on Ubuntu as well.

As always, if you have any questions or run into issues, please post in the course discussion forums to get help. Good luck!
