#### Video Script

Hello and welcome to the week four announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 510 in fall 2025. So this week you should be working on lab two. The quizzes for lab two are due this Wednesday, so make sure you get those done soon. The next lab is due on next Wednesday, so you're going to turn in lab two then. And in two weeks from now, we're going to have our first discussion. So the questions for that discussion topic are going to be due two weeks from today, actually. So make sure you got that on your calendar. 

So for lab two, real quick, just a reminder on lab two, where you're doing Puppet, it is Canvas only. There is no meeting required for Lab 2 grading. All you're going to do on Canvas is you're going to take your two Puppet script files, the .pp files. You're going to upload those to Canvas. And then Josh and I, what we're going to do is we're going to take your scripts, run them on our brand new updated VMs. We're going to run your script once, reboot it, run it again, and then we're going to check to make sure it did everything it's supposed to do. So hopefully that makes sense. If you have questions on Lab 2, you can still schedule a meeting, but generally Lab 2 does not require any interactive grading. You just submit everything on Canvas. 

So I've been working on getting our discussions speakers scheduled. I've got the first two on the calendar. First up is going to be Seth Galitzer, who is speaking two weeks from today on September 30th at 2.30. Seth is the engineering IT manager and formerly the computer science system administrator. He was our sysadmin for over 15 years. He's also a K-State CS grad from the late 90s. So he knows a lot of the classes that you're taking right now as a computer science student. Seth is a really great resource on campus. He's one of the best sysadmins I know. And so he's going to come in and talk to you a little bit about his job, what he does to help manage the systems for an academic department like computer science. And also he's going to talk a little bit about his transition and role from the CSS admin to now engineering IT manager as we consolidate IT across all the different departments within engineering. So put that on your calendar. 

Quick reminder for these to get points for them, you need to submit questions before the session starts. So sometime before Tuesday at 2.30, you need to submit some questions for Seth. And then you can either attend the live Zoom and ask Seth a question. You have to ask a question to get points for attendance. Or if you're unable to ask a question or you're unable to attend in person, I will have the session recorded and then you can watch the recording afterward and there'll be a short discussion prompt I'll have you respond to based on that recording. So there are many different ways you can can participate in this. I really want people to try and attend the video if you can and that's why we tried to schedule as best we could the most people are available. But if not, that's okay. You'll be able to watch the recording. 

One other thing that's coming up next week is, if you know, I host tea time office hours in the computer science department every week. Tea time office hours is a great chance for you to meet with faculty, staff, advisors, and other students and talk about life, the universe, and everything. Specifically, we host a few panels every semester. And so our first panel is going to be coming up this Monday, September 22nd at 10 a.m. It's a career fair prep and industry panel. We're going to host the career center person for engineering, which is Liz Parks. She's going to come in and talk about what the career center can do. And then we're going to have a panel of industry and alumni folks that you can talk with. They're going to give you tips on how to work a career fair, on resumes, on job searching, on interviews, anything you want to know there. So again, this is Monday, September 22nd at 10 a.m. It's in Engineering 2168, which is the conference hall at the west end of the second floor by the CS offices, or you can join on Zoom. The Zoom link is posted online a lot of places. So hopefully you can find it, or you can always ping me and let me know. 

So other than that, hopefully things are going well. If you have any questions, keep in touch on Ed Discussion. You can also find me on Discord and Teams and during office hours. So best of luck this week, and I will see you all again next week.
