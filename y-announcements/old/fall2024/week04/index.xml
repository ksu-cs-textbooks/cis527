So this week you should be working on the discussion questions for our first discussion this Wednesday, which will be hosted by Kyle Hutson. I’ll talk about him in just a second. Those questions are due about an hour before the session starts so that I can go through them, but you’re invited to attend live in person so you can see his presentation and ask him questions via Zoom and get your response points there as well. Next week lab two is due on Wednesday so make sure you’re working on lab two to get that done soon and then next Wednesday the response for discussion one is also going to be due.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2024/week04/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
