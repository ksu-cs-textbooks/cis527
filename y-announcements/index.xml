      <description>Ed Discussion This video was recorded before I decided to switch to Ed Discussion instead of using Discord. All discussions of &amp;ldquo;Discord&amp;rdquo; can be applied to &amp;ldquo;Ed Discussion&amp;rdquo; instead. Sorry for the confusion! - Russ

      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Video Script Hello and welcome to the week two announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 510 in Fall 2023. I&amp;rsquo;ll try and post announcements videos like this about every other week in this class. Usually these announcements videos are pretty informal, so you&amp;rsquo;ll notice I don&amp;rsquo;t have my background set up or anything, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a chance for me to talk through some things that are on my mind, things that I would normally announce at the beginning of class if we were meeting in person.</description>
