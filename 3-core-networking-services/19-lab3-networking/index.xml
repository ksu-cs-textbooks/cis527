In all of these diagrams, I am using a sample network with the IP address 192.168.40.0. You will have to adapt the IPs to match your network configuration. In addition, each network address will need to be updated with your unique eID as directed in the lab assignment.
Before Lab 3 Once youâ€™ve completed Task 1 of Lab 3, you should have three virtual machines connected to your network.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/3-core-networking-services/19-lab3-networking/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
