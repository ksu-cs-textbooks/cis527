So this week you should be getting started on the first lab. Please bear in mind I do have a megathread on ed discussion for this lab. So if you have any questions or concerns with this lab, I’d really recommend that you post in the ed discussion and also check there, but you can also email to do lab grading. I get a lot of questions about lab grading in this class. The way this works is you’re going to schedule a time slot to meet with either the GTA Josh or myself. You need to meet with us before the lab is due. You can schedule your time slot anytime. So even if you’re not done with the lab right now, you can schedule a time slot for next Wednesday sometime when the lab is due, but you need to have the lab done before that time slot, obviously. So you schedule a time slot. Please check Josh’s calendar first. And then if he doesn’t have any times available that works for you, then schedule with me. Please bear in mind, I am generally very busy on Mondays because I’m on campus and then a little bit on Wednesdays and Thursdays as I have lab meetings and other things going on those days. Tuesdays and Fridays are usually pretty open for me. So anyway, schedule with Josh first, then me using our calendly links, or I also have a booking link that you can use.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week02/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
