So this week you should be finishing up lab one. Lab one grading is due tonight by 7pm. So if you haven’t scheduled a time to meet with me for grading, make sure you do that ASAP. I do have trainings on Monday afternoons from about one to three, I usually get done with those a little earlier. But it’s worth noting that at least half of my afternoon is taken up by another meeting. So make sure you schedule your schedule your grading times in advance so that you can get those in whenever they work for you. And of course, if you work from eight to five, let me know and I’ll make some time available in my calendar probably after 5pm. So around six or seven to get you taken care of coming up this week, you’ve got lab two quizzes, which are due on Friday. And then next week, you’ll be turning in lab two and the first discussion which is the week two discussion.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/summer2022/week02/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
