Recall that all systems are currently configured to get DHCP and DNS information from your Ubuntu VM labelled Server, so in general it must be running at all times for this network to function. In addition, the Ubuntu VM labelled Server does not use itself for DNS, but still uses the VMare built-in DNS server, though you may have configured an alternate entry so it can refer to itself for DNS as well. This is the most likely starting point for this lab if you completed Lab 3.</p><h3 id=starting-lab-4-with-a-working-lab-3-solution>Starting Lab 4 with a Working Lab 3 Solution</h3><p><a href=#R-image-c0091de70c3b99a1291af85a5b24068e class=lightbox-link><img alt="Before Lab 4 with Working Lab 3" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/net-beforelab4working3.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In Lab 4, most of the changes required to get from the final Lab 3 network to this configuration are spread across multiple tasks. However, here are the major highlights:</p><ol start=0><li><strong>VMware NAT Network</strong> - the built-in DHCP server should still be disabled as it was in Lab 3.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Server VM</strong> - now uses itself as a primary DNS entry, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 4). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM</strong> - no changes, still gets both DNS and DHCP from the Ubuntu Server VM (Lab 4, Task 5). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Windows Server VM</strong> - new VM (Lab 4, Task 1). Should have a static IP address of <code>192.168.40.42</code> and a primary static DNS entry pointing to itself, with an alternate entry set to the Ubuntu Server VM or the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 2). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> - now has a static DNS entry to point to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the Ubuntu Server VM or the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 3). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM - Windows Snapshot</strong> - when configuring the Ubuntu Client VM to connect to Windows Active Directory, it should have a static DNS entry pointing to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the Ubuntu Server VM or the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 6). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li></ol><p>This is the ideal setup for a this lab, but it depends on a fully working Lab 3 solution. In addition, you&rsquo;ll need to keep the Ubuntu Server VM running at all times, which may present a problem on systems that struggle to run multiple VMs concurrently. So, below I discuss two alternative options.</p><h4 id=lab-4-alternative-network-setup---option-1-static-dns-entries>Lab 4 Alternative Network Setup - Option 1 (Static DNS Entries)</h4><p><a href=#R-image-33b64ac16deaced0b0385552624123d6 class=lightbox-link><img alt="Before Lab 4 Alternate 1" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/net-beforelab4alt1.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In addition, we are avoiding using our own DNS server running on the Ubuntu Server VM unless absolutely necessary. So, the following changes are made to the network from Lab 3:</p><ol start=0><li><strong>VMware NAT Network</strong> - the built-in DHCP server must be re-enabled if it was disabled in Lab 3.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Server VM</strong> - now uses itself as a primary DNS entry, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 4). The DHCP server that was configured in Lab 3 is disabled using <code>sudo systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server</code>. Must still be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM</strong> - now gets a DHCP address from VMware. We must set a primary static DNS entry to point to the Ubuntu Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 5). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code></li><li><strong>Windows Server VM</strong> - new VM (Lab 4, Task 1). Should have a static IP address of <code>192.168.40.42</code> and a primary static DNS entry pointing to itself, with an alternate entry set to the the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 2). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> - now has a static DNS entry to point to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 3). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM - Windows Snapshot</strong> - when configuring the Ubuntu Client VM to connect to Windows Active Directory, it should have a static DNS entry pointing to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 6). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li></ol><p>In effect, each system that is getting automatic IP addresses is now using the VMware DHCP server. However, since that DHCP server does not give the correct DNS addresses, we must set static DNS entries on <strong>everything</strong>, with the Ubuntu Server VM and Ubuntu Client VM pointing to the DNS server running on the Ubuntu Server VM, and the Windows Server, Windows 10 Client, and the Ubuntu Client VM&rsquo;s Windows Snapshot pointing to the DNS server running on the Windows Server (after Active Directory is installed). In addition, each of those systems should have an alternate DNS entry that points to the VMware DNS server, allowing them to still access the internet properly.</p><p>However, if you are still having issues with your DNS entries or DNS servers not working correctly, fear not! There is one more alternative option available to you.</p><h4 id=lab-4-alternative-network-setup---option-2-hosts-file-entries>Lab 4 Alternative Network Setup - Option 2 (Hosts File Entries)</h4><p><a href=#R-image-08a5086726da3a79642f1a848250d8bb class=lightbox-link><img alt="Before Lab 4 Alternate 2" class="border lazy lightbox noshadow figure-image" loading=lazy src=/cis527/images/net-beforelab4alt2.png style=height:auto;width:auto></a>

In addition, we are avoiding using our own DNS server running on the Ubuntu Server VM unless absolutely necessary. Finally, we are adding entries to the <code>hosts</code> file on each system to bypass DNS completely, ensuring that we can still complete this lab even if our DNS systems are not working at all. So, the following changes are made to the network from Lab 3:</p><ol start=0><li><strong>VMware NAT Network</strong> - the built-in DHCP server must be re-enabled if it was disabled in Lab 3.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Server VM</strong> - now uses itself as a primary DNS entry, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 4). The DHCP server that was configured in Lab 3 is disabled using <code>sudo systemctl disable isc-dhcp-server</code>. Must still be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.41</code> to <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM</strong> - now gets a DHCP address from VMware. We must set a primary static DNS entry to point to the Ubuntu Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 5). Must be able to resolve <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.41</code> to <code>ldap.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Windows Server VM</strong> - new VM (Lab 4, Task 1). Should have a static IP address of <code>192.168.40.42</code> and a primary static DNS entry pointing to itself, with an alternate entry set to the the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 2). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, you are better off just rebuilding your AD server - this should always work on a working AD server!</li><li><strong>Windows 10 VM</strong> - now has a static DNS entry to point to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 3). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.42</code> to <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li><li><strong>Ubuntu Client VM - Windows Snapshot</strong> - when configuring the Ubuntu Client VM to connect to Windows Active Directory, it should have a static DNS entry pointing to the Windows Server VM, with an alternate entry set to the VMware DNS server (Lab 4, Task 6). Once the Active Directory server is installed, it should be able to resolve <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>. If it cannot, add an entry to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file that links <code>192.168.40.42</code> to <code>ad.&lt;your eID>.cis527.org</code>.</li></ol><p>In essence, we still configure each system with the correct static DNS entries. However, as a fallback in case those DNS entries are not working properly, we can use entries in the <code>hosts</code> file to bypass DNS completely and guarantee that we&rsquo;re always going to get to the correct system.</p><p>This is a very useful workaround, and while an <em>ideal</em> network in the real world shouldn&rsquo;t require it, many times system administrators include entries in the <code>hosts</code> file to ensure that systems can still be used in the event of DNS failure. Otherwise, an innocuous DNS failure could prevent users from even logging on to the system, either via LDAP or Active Directory.</p><p>As shown in the diagram above, the only DNS entry that <strong>must</strong> work is the Windows Server VM must be able to use itself for DNS. If that does not work, then most likely your Active Directory configuration failed and you will need to try again. Windows Active Directory relies heavily on DNS to function properly. I&rsquo;ve not ever had this happen in my experience, so I highly doubt this failure case will be common.</p><p>You can find more information about how to edit your hosts file at <a href=https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/hosts-file/ rel=external target=_blank>this resource</a>.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis527/js/clipboard.min.js?1727992944 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1727992944 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/theme.js?1727992944 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/embed-iframe.js?1727992944 defer></script></body></html>
