So this is a list of everything that’s remaining do in this class. For the rest of the semester, we’ve got lab six that’s due today, you’ve got a discussion that’s due after Thanksgiving, your final project proposal is due after Thanksgiving. And then we have lab seven, discussion, five. And the final project I’ll do right around finals week. So there’s really not a whole lot left in this class. As long as you’re keeping up. Hopefully, you can get everything taken care of. But this gives you an idea. All of this is on Canvas as well.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2022/week13/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
