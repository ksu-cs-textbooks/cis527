#### Video Transcript

Welcome to Module 5! In this module, we'll learn all about one of the hottest topics in system administration today: the cloud! Many enterprises today are in the process of moving their operations to the cloud, or may have already completely done so. However, some organizations may not find it feasible to use the cloud for their operations, and we'll discuss some of those limitations.

For the lab assignment, you'll create a few cloud systems and learn how to configure them for security and usability, We'll also start creating some cloud resources for an organization, which we'll continue working with in Lab 6.

As a sidenote, this lab involves working with resources on the cloud, and will require you to sign up and pay for those services. In general, your total cost should be low, usually around $20 total. If you haven't already, you can sign up for the GitHub Student Developer Pack, linked in the resources below this video, to get discounts on most of these items. If you have any concerns about using these services, please contact me to make alternative arrangements! While I highly recommend working with actual cloud services in this course, there are definitely other ways to complete this material.

As always, if you have any questions or run into issues, please post in the course discussion forums to get help. Good luck!
