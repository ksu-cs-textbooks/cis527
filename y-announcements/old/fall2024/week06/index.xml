This week we have our second discussion session hosted on Wednesday, so we’ll talk about that in just a minute. Next Wednesday the response for that discussion is due and the questions for that discussion are due this Wednesday right before we start. And then also next Wednesday lab three is due as well. So for lab three, which you should be working on this week is adding some core network services to our Ubuntu VMs. You’re going to set static IP addresses. You’re going to install a DNS server and a DHCP server. You’re also going to install SNMP so that you can view some of your network statistics across the network. You’ll also install Wireshark and use that to capture some packets. All of this is really useful stuff to understand how networking services work.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2024/week06/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
