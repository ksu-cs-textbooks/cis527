I’m coming to you this week from my office on campus because I’m on the road a little bit. Hopefully the video quality is not too bad and you can get everything that I need to get across in these announcements. So for this week you should be working on lab four. Lab four is due this Friday so make sure that you’re getting that done and have your grading time scheduled. Right now I have a lot of availability on Friday and I believe Josh should also have availability toward the end of the week so hopefully you can get your grading time scheduled. If you’re having any questions or issues with the lab let us know and we’ll definitely work with you on that and then next week you’ll transition over and start working on lab five.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2024/week09/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
