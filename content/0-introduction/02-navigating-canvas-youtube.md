This course is currently using YouTube for video hosting. In general, any references to Mediasite can be replaced with YouTube. The YouTube videos also include captions as described below. Currently, we are able to provide higher quality videos via YouTube than Mediasite, so that is the major reason behind the change. I'll try to update this video at a later date.

#### Video Script

This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.

When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage, with my contact information and any important information about the course. This is a quick, easy reference for you if you ever need to get in touch with me.

Let's walk through the options in the main menu to the left. First, any course announcements will be posted in the Announcements section, which is available here. Those announcements will also be configured to send emails to all students when they are posted, though in your personal Canvas settings you can disable email notifications if you so choose. Please make sure you check here often for any updates to course information.

The next section is Modules, which is where you'll primarily interact with the course. You'll notice that I've disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.

When you first arrive at the Modules section, you'll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren't working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name. I'll do so, leaving the introductory module open.

As you look at each module, you'll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says "Complete All Items." Likewise, the following modules may list a prerequisite module, which you must complete before you can access it.

Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you'll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say "view," which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say "contribute," "submit," or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.

Let's click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You've already been to this page by this point. Most course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.

While I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.

When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the "Next" button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add "Next" and "Previous" buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I'll click through a couple of items here.

At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You'll notice that I've viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you've already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you've completed.

Continuing down the menu to the left, you'll find links to the discussion forums for this course. If you have any questions about an assignment or would like to discuss any topic with your fellow classmates, this is a great place to do so.

Finally, you'll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.

Let's go back to the Course Introduction page, and look at some of the features of the ~~Mediasite~~ YouTube video player that may be useful to you as you go through this course.

When you load the player, it gives you a control toolbar at the bottom with several options. From left to right, you can restart the video, control playback speed, adjust the volume, enable subtitled captions, see information about the video, open the video in a new window, and find additional options by clicking the menu button.

Every video in this course will have subtitles available, though the subtitles may be slightly garbled as they are automatically transcribed from the audio. I will do my best to edit them to be as accurate as possible. This will make the videos accessible to all students. In addition, studies have shown that a large number of video viewers prefer to have subtitles available even if they do not have any hearing impairment. So, please feel free to enable subtitles at any time.

In addition, I will attempt to speak as clearly as possible when creating the videos. If you feel that I am going too fast, or that you can keep up with me going more quickly, feel free to adjust the playback speed as needed. I have been known to absorb lecture videos at 1.5x playback speed myself, depending on the content.  

Finally, I will make available any download links for the videos themselves. In most cases, the downloadable videos will use an offline version of the ~~Mediasite~~ YouTube player to make all the features available. If you are interested in getting these videos in another format, please contact me.
