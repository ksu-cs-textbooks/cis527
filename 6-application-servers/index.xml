In this module, we’ll discuss the various types of servers that you may come across in a large organization. This could include file servers, web servers, application servers, database servers, and more!
In the lab assignment, you’ll set up a file server on both Windows and Ubuntu, and deal with automatically providing access to those resources for your users. You’ll also configure the IIS and Apache web servers, and learn about installing an application on each. Finally, we’ll discuss some of the considerations for configuring a database server, and you’ll work with setting up a database server on Ubuntu as well.</description></item><item><title>Application Servers Overview</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/02-application-servers-overview/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/02-application-servers-overview/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides 10 Tips for Successfully Implementing Enterprise Software from Liquid State An Analyst’s Guide to Evaluating Enterprise Software from Automation World 18 Enterprise Software Selection Risks and How to Avoid Them from CIO.com Video Transcript This module is all about application servers.

The best way to accomplish this is to treat this assignment like a checklist and check things off as you complete them.
If you have any questions about these items or are unsure what they mean, please contact the instructor. Remember that part of being a system administrator (and a software developer in general) is working within vague specifications to provide what your client is requesting, so eliciting additional information is a very necessary skill.</description></item><item><title>File Servers Overview</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/04-file-servers-overview/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/04-file-servers-overview/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Standard RAID Levels on Wikipedia Nested RAID Levelson Wikipedia Parity from Crystal Clear Mathematics What are the Different Types of Storage: Block, Object and File? on Ubuntu Blog NAS vs. SAN vs. DAS: Which is Right for You? from Seagate Blog Getting Started with Storage: Understanding SAN vs NAS vs DAS from Vanilla Video Video Transcript The first type of application server we will cover in this module is the file server. In essence, a file server is simply a system on the network that is responsible for sharing files and storage resources to users in our organization. While that may seem simple on the surface, there is quite a bit going on behind the scenes.</description></item><item><title>Windows File Server</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/05-windows-file-server/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/05-windows-file-server/index.html</guid><description>Resources Windows Group Policy How to Share Files and Folders in Windows Server 2016 from Tactig How to Map Network Drives with Group Policy (Complete Guide) by Robert Allen on Active Directory Pro How to: Mapping Network Drives/Folders via Group Policy on Spiceworks Community Video Transcript In this video, I’ll briefly walk you through the steps of setting up a file server in Windows Server 2016, as well as how to access those resources from a Windows 10 client on the same network.

A web server is the software that is used to make websites available on the World Wide Web. So, it is responsible for listening and responding to HTTP requests. The software is typically designed so it can handle many simultaneous connections, and even serve multiple websites as we saw in Lab 5. Additionally, many web servers support features for caching and server-side scripting languages, making them a truly versatile platform for serving both web pages and web-based applications.</description></item><item><title>Database Servers</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/08-database-servers/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/08-database-servers/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides 5 Tips for Managing Database Servers in Production from Cloud 66 10 Easy Tips for Better SQL Server Performance from ITPro Today What Kind of Disks Should You Use with Microsoft SQL Server 2016? from Heroix Blog Database Encryption on Wikipedia Encrypting Data at Rest on Servers: What Does it Get You? from HLN Consulting Video Transcript One of the other most commonly used application servers in an enterprise is a database server. You may also see the term “Database Management System” or “DBMS” used in some areas to refer to the same thing. A database server is typically the backbone of your organization’s data storage, as it can be used to store and retrieve a large amount of data very efficiently. Depending on the server software, the data may be stored in large files on the file system, or the database server may work directly with a block-level storage device for even more performance.</description></item><item><title>Windows Web Server</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/09-windows-web-server/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/6-application-servers/09-windows-web-server/index.html</guid><description>Note The first part of this video references ASP.NET 4.6, which has been replaced by ASP.NET 4.7 in Windows Server 2019.
