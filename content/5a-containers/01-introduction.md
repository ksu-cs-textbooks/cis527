#### Video Transcript

Welcome to module 5 A - the first new module added to this course in several years. In this module, we're going to explore one of the biggest trends in system administration - containerization. We'll see how containers have quickly overtaken traditional virtual machines for running workloads in the cloud, and how tools such as Docker make using containers quick and easy. We'll also learn how we can use containers in our own development workflows, making it much easier to build tools that will work as seamlessly in the cloud as they do on a local system. Finally, we'll take a look at Kubernetes, which has quickly become the most talked about tool for orchestrating containers in the cloud. 

Before we begin, I want to give a huge shout out to the TechWorld with Nana channel on YouTube, which is linked at the top of this page. Her comprehensive video courses on Docker and Kubernetes are the most well organized resources for those tools I've come across, and much of the structure of this module is inspired by her work. So, I must give credit where it is due, and I encourage you to check out her resources as well.

We'll start by taking a look at the architecture of containers in general, and then we'll dive in to using Docker on our own systems. Let's get started!
