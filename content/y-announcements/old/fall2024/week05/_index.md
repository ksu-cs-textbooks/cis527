Hello, and welcome to the week five announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 510 in fall 2024. This week, you should be working on lab two, which is due today. We'll talk about that momentarily. You also should be working on your response to the first discussion we had last Wednesday with Kyle Hudson. That response is due today, so make sure you get that submitted on Canvas. Then you'll start in on lab three. So the quizzes for lab three are due next week. And then you'll have the second discussion questions are due next Wednesday. And then in two weeks, you'll be turning in lab three and your second discussion. 

So for lab two, all you have to do is submit your two puppet manifest files via Canvas. You don't have to schedule a meeting with myself or Josh unless you have any questions about your submission. Once you get your stuff submitted, we'll probably go in tomorrow and enter a grade of one for everybody that has submitted the labs so that it will unlock lab three so you can get started on it. That will unlock the model solutions for lab two as well. And so that's why we wait until you've submitted it and we put in a grade so that it will unlock the next lab. So no meeting is required for lab two. If you have any questions, feel free to post on that discussion or send us an email and we'd be happy to help. 

So next Wednesday, our second discussion will be Seth Galitzer. Seth Galitzer is a name you've hopefully seen before. He is our computer support person for computer science. He runs all of our research servers. He runs the CS Linux server that you probably interacted with and has a lot of experience doing both desktop and server support at K -State. So we're going to have that talk with him, not this Wednesday, but next Wednesday at 2:30 p.m. in our office hours Zoom room. So make sure you think of some questions you wanna ask Seth so that you get those published on Canvas by next week. So we've got some questions to ask Seth when he is here. 

So next week, you're gonna start working on lab three. Lab three involves core networking services such as DNS, DHCP, SNMP, Wireshark, all of these cool network tools. It's purely done mostly in Ubuntu. You don't do much in Windows on this lab except maybe test a couple of things in Windows. So the big thing with lab three is you're gonna want to read the documentation for all of these tools very carefully and make sure you understand them. There's a lot of hints and diagrams out there that you can look at. And of course, as always, ask questions. One of the big keys of this class is I don't give you all of the answers right away. I expect you to come to me and ask questions if something doesn't make sense. So don't be afraid to reach out and ask questions and learn from that discussion as well. 

So that's really all I've got this week. As always, you can keep in touch by posting an Ed discussion on Discord or Teams by coming to Tea Time Office Hours, which are Mondays at one o 'clock, and then by scheduling one -on -one office hours with either Josh or I anytime that you need help via Calendly. So hopefully you're really excited about getting into networking this week. I think it's one of the most interesting topics we cover in this class, and it's definitely one that you probably haven't done a lot with in the past unless you have some server experience. So hopefully this is a really interesting lab for you. As always, if you have any questions, let us know, and I will see you again next week.
