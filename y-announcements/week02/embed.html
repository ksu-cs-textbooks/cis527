So this week you should be getting ready to have your first lab grading scheduled. So what you need to do to get your labs graded is schedule a time slot to meet with either Josh or myself. Sometime via Zoom before that lab is due. Remember not only do you have to schedule your grading time but the grade time has to happen before the deadline. We have some students that are unclear that they just have to schedule the lab grading and then they can get it graded after the deadline. The grading actually has to happen before the deadline.</p><p>So when you schedule your time slot you&rsquo;ll go to the home page on Canvas. You&rsquo;ll scroll down a little bit and you&rsquo;ll find the instructions for this. What I&rsquo;d like you to do is check Josh&rsquo;s calendar first and schedule a time with Josh if he&rsquo;s available during a time you&rsquo;re available. If his calendar is full or any of his times don&rsquo;t work for you then you can schedule with me. We just do that so that Josh&rsquo;s time gets used up most efficiently and then you can take up my time as needed. When you schedule our meetings by default are only 15 minutes long so we kind of depend on you to come prepared. And so that means that you should have everything ready to go have your VMs both booted have everything pulled up. You can even look at the lab a little bit and figure out what things we&rsquo;re going to want to look at. There&rsquo;s some lab grading checklists out there. So do the best you can have everything ready to go so that we can just click through it. If everything is ready it should only take a few minutes to grade. But if you have trouble or you don&rsquo;t have your lab started up sometimes that can take a long time.</p><p>But basically be prepared to demonstrate your work. We will ask you to show us things that you did in the lab. We may not exactly tell you how to do them. So you need to be prepared to demonstrate your work and your understanding. So if we ask you to show us where all the users are at and prove to us that you created the users you&rsquo;re supposed to. You should be able to find a place where you can show us that and prove that some of the times we will just give you some commands. For example on Linux we may just give you some terminal commands to check things just because that&rsquo;s a lot quicker. So we&rsquo;ll work with you on that. If you have any questions or concerns about the lab grading let us know. pretty straightforward, but you just have to kind of try it once and you&rsquo;ll see what it looks like.</p><p>So for the discussions, I sent out a when to meet poll on the announcements earlier last week. So please check that out and fill that out if you can. I&rsquo;ll try and get the discussion scheduled later this week. And then the full schedule of speakers is coming soon. We&rsquo;ll try and have our first discussion here in early September. I try to get between three to five guest speakers each semester. So the schedule will be coming very soon. Remember for the discussions to get full credit for those, you need to submit two questions on Canvas before the discussion starts. And then you can either attend the live discussion session on Zoom or you can watch the video afterward and write a small response to that video just to show that you watched it. And then outside of that, whenever we don&rsquo;t have a guest speaker, we&rsquo;ll use that discussion time as live office hours where I will hang out in Zoom for a little while if you have any questions there.</p><p>So, as a quick reminder in this class, you can get help a couple of ways. One of the best things to do is email the cis527-help email address. That email goes to both myself and Josh so that either of us can answer that email very quickly. If you email one or the other of us directly and we&rsquo;re busy, it may take a little bit longer to get an answer. So, please remember to use that help email if you can. Another great place to ask for help is a discussion. Josh and I have both been very active on the discussion answering questions there. So, please check that out. And then if you need to meet with us one -on -one for office hours, we have Calendly links available for office hours and grading. So, you can always use Calendly. Hopefully, everything&rsquo;s going well this semester. We&rsquo;ve kind of made the change from Windows 10 and Ubuntu 22 to Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24. I think that&rsquo;s been mostly a smooth transition so far, but there are some little questions coming in. So, if you&rsquo;re running the issues, check ed discussion, see if we&rsquo;ve talked about your issues before. And if not, feel free to make a post there and we&rsquo;ll try and answer it. Josh and I are on top of things. We&rsquo;ve got our model solutions ready to go so we can check things out if you run into something strange. But otherwise, hopefully lab grading this week goes well and let us know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I will see you in another announcements video next week. Good luck.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main></div><script src=/cis527/js/clipboard.min.js?1737134619 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/perfect-scrollbar.min.js?1737134619 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/theme.js?1737134619 defer></script><script src=/cis527/js/embed-iframe.js?1737134619 defer></script></body></html>
