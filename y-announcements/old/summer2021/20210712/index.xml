So at this point, you should be working on lab five, which is due tonight by 7pm. I see I’ve got meetings for most everybody already on my calendar. So that’s great. It looks like everybody’s keeping up so far. Then we’ve got our speaker coming up, we didn’t have a speaker last week, we’ve rescheduled Hunter to the week after this one. So you don’t have a response due this week. But you do have questions for our next speaker, which is going to be Sarah. She’s going to be speaking this week. So don’t forget to get those questions turned in. And the next week, you’ll be working on lab six, which is also due by Monday at 7pm.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/summer2021/20210712/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
