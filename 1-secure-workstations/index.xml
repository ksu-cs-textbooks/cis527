Before we get to working directly within a system, here is some background information about users and groups to help you understand why they are so important.

As computers became more powerful, the concept of time-sharing became increasingly important. While one user was reviewing outputs or rewriting code, another user could use the computer to run a program. To keep track of each person’s usage, user accounts were introduced.</description></item><item><title>Windows 10 Overview &amp; Installation</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/1-secure-workstations/05-windows-overview-installation/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/1-secure-workstations/05-windows-overview-installation/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides How to Get Windows 11 from Microsoft Azure Portal via CS Support How to Install VMware Tools from VMware Windows 11 Overview from Microsoft Windows 11 Overview for System Administrators from Microsoft Microsoft Windows Version History from Wikipedia Windows 11 Help from Microsoft Windows 10 Architecture from Microsoft TechNet Windows 11 ISO Downloads from Microsoft Warning: May not work with keys from the Microsoft Imagine store!

So, the more processes you run, the slower your computer may seem as you consume more of the available resources.</description></item><item><title>Windows 10 Software Installation</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/1-secure-workstations/10-windows-software-installation/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/1-secure-workstations/10-windows-software-installation/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides Installation (Computer Programs) on Wikipedia Here’s What Happens when you Install the Top 10 Download.com Apps from How-To Geek Process Monitor from Microsoft Sysinternals InstallWatch Pro from Lo4d.com Video Script One major part of configuring a computer is installing the desired software.
