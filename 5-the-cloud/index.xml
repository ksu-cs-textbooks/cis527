In this module, we’ll learn all about one of the hottest topics in system administration today: the cloud! Many enterprises today are in the process of moving their operations to the cloud, or may have already completely done so. However, some organizations may not find it feasible to use the cloud for their operations, and we’ll discuss some of those limitations.</description></item><item><title>The Cloud Overview</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/02-the-cloud-overview/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/02-the-cloud-overview/index.html</guid><description>Note TODO As of 2020, both KSIS and HRIS have moved to the cloud, leaving very few K-State resources hosted directly on campus. This video will be updated in future semesters to reflect that change. -Russ

At this point, some of you may be wondering what exactly I’m talking about when I refer to the cloud. My hope is that, by the end of this video, you’ll have a much clearer mental picture of exactly what the cloud is and how it is related to all of the things we’ve been working with in this class so far.</description></item><item><title>Assignment</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/03-assignment/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/03-assignment/index.html</guid><description>Lab 5 - The Cloud Instructions Create two cloud systems meeting the specifications given below. The best way to accomplish this is to treat this assignment like a checklist and check things off as you complete them.
If you have any questions about these items or are unsure what they mean, please contact the instructor. Remember that part of being a system administrator (and a software developer in general) is working within vague specifications to provide what your client is requesting, so eliciting additional information is a very necessary skill.</description></item><item><title>Cloud Resource Setup</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/04-cloud-resource-setup/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/04-cloud-resource-setup/index.html</guid><description>Note TODO This video was recorded for Ubuntu 18.04, but works for Ubuntu 22.04 as well. When creating a droplet, simply select the newest version of Ubuntu LTS. This video shows an older version of the DigitalOcean UI, but should be similar to what you see today. –Russ

However, we haven’t done anything to secure the connection between our users and our cloud system, which means that any information sent via HTTP to and from our server can be intercepted and read by a malicious third party. As you’ll recall, in Module 3 we showed how simple it is to do just that using Wireshark.</description></item><item><title>Scaling &amp; High Availability</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/07-scaling-high-availability/index.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5-the-cloud/07-scaling-high-availability/index.html</guid><description>Resources Slides An Introduction to Droplet Metadata from DigitalOcean How to Resize Droplets from DigitalOcean How to Automate the Scaling of Your Web Application on DigitalOcean Ubuntu 16.04 Droplets from DigitalOcean Load Balancers from DigitalOcean What is High Availability? from DigitalOcean AWS Auto Scaling from Amazon Web Services Netflix Case Study Netflix: What Happens When You Press Play? from High Scalability Blog Scryer: Netflix’s Predictive Auto Scaling Engine from Netflix Technology Blog Completing the Cloud Migration from Netflix DevOps Case Study: Netflix and the Chaos Monkey from DevOps Blog at CMU Software Engineering Institute Chaos Engineering Upgraded from Netflix Technology Blog Video Transcript One of the major selling points of the cloud is its rapid elasticity, or the ability of your cloud resources to grow and shrink as needed to handle your workload. In this video, you’ll learn a bit more about how to configure your cloud resources to be elastic, as well as some of the many design decisions and tradeoffs you’ll face when building a cloud system.</description></item></channel></rss>
