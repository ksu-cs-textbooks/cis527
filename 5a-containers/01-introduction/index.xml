In this module, we’re going to explore one of the biggest trends in system administration - containerization. We’ll see how containers have quickly overtaken traditional virtual machines for running workloads in the cloud, and how tools such as Docker make using containers quick and easy. We’ll also learn how we can use containers in our own development workflows, making it much easier to build tools that will work as seamlessly in the cloud as they do on a local system. Finally, we’ll take a look at Kubernetes, which has quickly become the most talked about tool for orchestrating containers in the cloud.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5a-containers/01-introduction/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
