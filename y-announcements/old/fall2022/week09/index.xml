So this week, lab four is due, I believe most of you scheduled time either yesterday or today to get lab four graded. So good job on that. Hopefully that’s all working well. And then you’ll also start working on lab five content this week. Next week, lab five, you’re going to be working on it, it’ll be due the following Monday. And there’s also the third discussion in this class, which becomes due very shortly.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2022/week09/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
