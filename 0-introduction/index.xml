      <description>YouTube Video Resources Slides Syllabus Video Script Welcome to CIS 527 - Enterprise System Administration and CC 510 - Computer Systems Administration. Even though these are two different courses in the catalog, they teach the same content and will use the same Canvas course. So, anywhere you see CIS 527 in this course, you can also mentally substitute CC 510 in its place.
My name is Russell Feldhausen, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be your instructor for this course.</description>

      <description>warning-1 This video discusses the content present in this course as of Summer 2021. Labs 5 - 7 are being rewritten for Summer 2022, but since they are not available at the beginning of the semester, I went ahead and left this video as-is. So, please be aware that what is shown in this video may not reflect that actual content of the course once updates are published. -Russ</description>
