#### Video Transcript

For the rest of this module, you'll be working with DigitalOcean to create and configure online cloud resources. I chose DigitalOcean primarily because of its ease of use compared to other providers such as AWS, as well as its continuing popularity and great user documentation.

DigitalOcean was first founded in 2011 by Ben on Moisey Uretsky. They felt that most hosting companies of the time were targeting large enterprises, leaving many smaller software developers and startups behind. DigitalOcean was one of the first hosting providers to offer virtual machines exclusively on solid state storage, giving them a performance edge over many of their peers, while often being cheaper overall. Currently, they are the 3rd largest hosting provider in the world, with 12 worldwide datacenters serving over 1 million customers.

In this video, we'll discuss the first steps for getting your first cloud server, referred to as a "droplet" on DigitalOcean, configured and secured. Let's get to it!

First, if you haven't signed up for the GitHub Education Student Developer Pack, I highly encourage you to do so. Among many other perks included in the pack is a $50 credit for new DigitalOcean users. So, if you haven't used DigitalOcean before, or would like to create a new account for this class, you should take advantage of that resource. In total, the entire class should use less than half of that credit as long as you don't get behind, so you'll have plenty left over for other projects. Finally, if you have a friend or colleague already using DigitalOcean, you can contact them for their referral URL before you sign up to do them a solid favor, netting you a $10 sign-up credit, and they'll get a $25 credit once you spend $25 at DigitalOcean. It's a win-win for everyone involved!
