<p>Hello, and welcome to the week 11 Announcements video for CC 510 In Fall 2022, this week, you should be wrapping up lab five, which was due yesterday. So if you haven&rsquo;t already, make sure you schedule a time to get lab five graded. You&rsquo;re also should be looking at the third discussion in this class, which is due next week. And then you&rsquo;ll be starting on lab six with quizzes due next week and lab six itself being due the following week.</p>
<p>So for lab five grading, it&rsquo;s actually very, very simple. Usually lab five is one of the fastest to grade, basically, I just want to see you be able to ssh from your system to your front end system, and then SSH from your front end to back end in the cloud. We&rsquo;re going to check the firewall, the date and time and a few things on both of those systems. We&rsquo;re going to look at your Apache, your DNS configuration, your HTTPS, make sure all your certificates working. And it will also check out your Docker reverse proxy. A lot of it is if it works, it&rsquo;s great. It&rsquo;s very easy to do. If you have trouble, you can let me know. And we&rsquo;ll try and debug it and figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p>So for lab six, we&rsquo;re going to do a lot of different things on your local VMs. We&rsquo;re going to work on file servers and drive mappings. So you&rsquo;ll set up Samba on Linux, you know, setup file sharing in Windows, you&rsquo;ll also set up drive mappings on both clients attached to those parts of lab six required the lab for the Active Directory working for the Windows side, the Linux side, you don&rsquo;t actually have to have LDAP working as long as you have the same usernames and passwords everywhere it will work, you&rsquo;re also going to set up an application server. So on Windows, we&rsquo;re going to install an application server in IIS and a database and some things there. on the Linux side of things, we&rsquo;re going to do this in the cloud. So you&rsquo;ll build a couple of working web apps out in the cloud.</p>
<p>The other thing you should be thinking about at this point is your final project. There&rsquo;s lots of details out on Canvas about the final project, the basic idea is to either build something new or fix something existing that is related to it and System Administration. Some examples are maybe designing a web resource for new startups. So you&rsquo;re talking about building out the web resource, maybe Docker containers or Kubernetes, load balancing things like that. You could look at setting up laptops for school and doing some automation around puppet and some of those tools. You could design a central authentication system for a company would use Active Directory and LDAP. And how would you integrate it with different things you could look at using thin clients versus thick clients and labs thin clients would be if you&rsquo;re on campus, DUE 1113 where you remote desktop into a large server versus stick clients is where you have a desktop of some kind in every spot. Lots of different ideas for your final project. Feel free to chat with me if you want some ideas or to get an idea of things that you might be able to do. Basically, the big thing for the final project is you&rsquo;re going to do a SWOT analysis a strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats analysis of the idea of what you&rsquo;re proposing. And then you should do some small proof of concept that shows that you&rsquo;ve tinkered with it a little bit. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be at the same scope as your final project. But it should be something in that same realm. So again, if you&rsquo;re not sure what to do, feel free to chat with me and ask me questions. And I&rsquo;d be happy to help you get to a final project.</p>
<p>As working on this, don&rsquo;t forget, if you don&rsquo;t have it already, you can sign up for the GitHub education pack using this URL. Both DigitalOcean and Name Cheap, have really cheap stuff or free stuff depending on how you get there. Generally, you should be able to get whatever resources you need for this class as well as your final project for next to nothing. So make sure you look at those resources and let me know if you need if you have any questions or need a referral code or anything like that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, just feel free to keep in touch on Discord on email. You can schedule a one on one office hours, I&rsquo;m always here to help. Otherwise, we&rsquo;re getting near the end of the class. We&rsquo;ve just got two labs left in the final project. So hopefully things are going well. As always, if you have any questions, let me know and I will see you again in a couple weeks.</p>
