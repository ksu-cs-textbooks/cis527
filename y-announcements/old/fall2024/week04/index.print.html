id=video-script>Video Script</h4><p>Hello and welcome to the week four announcements video for CIS 527 and CC 510 in fall 2024. So this week you should be working on the discussion questions for our first discussion this Wednesday, which will be hosted by Kyle Hutson. I&rsquo;ll talk about him in just a second. Those questions are due about an hour before the session starts so that I can go through them, but you&rsquo;re invited to attend live in person so you can see his presentation and ask him questions via Zoom and get your response points there as well. Next week lab two is due on Wednesday so make sure you&rsquo;re working on lab two to get that done soon and then next Wednesday the response for discussion one is also going to be due.</p><p>So for lab two to clarify really quick lab two grading is done on canvas only. All you have to do is submit your puppet manifest files. You&rsquo;ll probably submit one or two files. Most students will submit two files, one for Ubuntu and one for Windows. You can combine them in the one file if you want, but you don&rsquo;t have to. You&rsquo;ll just submit your manifest files via canvas and then we will go through and we will grade those offline by running them on RBMs to make sure that they work. If you want to move ahead to lab three and you are done with lab two, you can email us and I will put in a one point score until we get the grading updated. That will unlock lab three, but it also unlocks the model solutions for lab two. So be aware that once we put that point in and unlock the model solutions, you can&rsquo;t go back and work on lab two again. But if you want to move ahead, just let us know. We&rsquo;re happy to do that. But for lab two, you just have to submit stuff on canvas. You don&rsquo;t have to schedule a Zoom meeting unless you have any questions.</p><p>So our first discussion is coming up tomorrow on Wednesday at two thirty. Our speaker this time is going to be Kyle Hutson. Kyle Hutson currently works at Lambda Labs, which is a big provider of GPU compute in the cloud for AI. He previously worked at KANREN, which is the Internet service provider for research organizations across Kansas, including K-State. Before that, he was a Beocat system admin for many, many years and got to be a really good friend with Kyle when he was here on campus working with Beocat. But now he works for Lambda Labs. He&rsquo;s going to be able to talk all about. performance computing and some of the stuff that he did both at Canren and at Lambda and that discussion again is on Wednesday at 2 30. It&rsquo;s in the Zoom room that we have for office hours. The Zoom information is posted on the homepage of Canvas.</p><p>To get points for this, there are two things you need to do. The first thing you need to do is submit a couple of questions you&rsquo;d like to ask Kyle before he presents on Wednesday. So you can look him up, you can go to Lambda Labs, you can find Kyle Hutson on LinkedIn, you can look at KANREN and Beocat to learn more about his history and see if there are a couple of questions you come up with that you want to ask him. Then you can either attend the live session Wednesday at 2 30 and participate by asking at least one question to get your participation points or afterwards you can watch the video and then write a short response to respond to a couple of prompts that I will have based on our discussion with Kyle. You respond to the prompts mainly just to show that you watched the video and understood what Kyle was talking about. Those are your two ways to get points for these discussions so make sure you keep that in mind. The questions are due tomorrow about an hour before the session starts. And then the response is due a week after that, next Wednesday.</p><p>That&rsquo;s really all we&rsquo;ve got going on this week. If you have any questions, you can keep in touch on Ed discussion. You can also keep in touch on Discord or Teams. You can join me for Tea Time office hours every Monday. We hold that every Monday at one o &lsquo;clock in 11, 17 on campus or on Zoom. Or you can also schedule one -on -one office hours with either myself or Josh. We&rsquo;re always here to help. Hopefully everything&rsquo;s going well in lab two. If you have any questions, let us know. Otherwise, I will see you next week.</p><footer class=footline></footer></article></div></main><div class=git-footer><p class=theme-version-footer>8.0.0</p><p>Last modified by:
