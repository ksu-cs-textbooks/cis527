So we’re on week three, which means that lab do… is lab two is due tonight at 7pm. So make sure you get that submitted, as we’ll talk about in a brief moment, the only things you have to submit on lab two are your two puppet manifest files. That’s all I need. Make sure on your manifest files if you installed any libraries that I need to install to test it, you put a little comment at the top of the file that’s also listed in in the assignment instructions. But a lot of students forget that step. Lab two is due tonight at 7pm. This Wednesday, we have the questions for week three. That should be the week three questions I forgot to change the slide. They’re due at midnight on Wednesday night. And then Thursday at 330. We have our guest speaker it’s Dr. Gary Pratt. I’ll talk about him in just a second. And then next week, you’ll be working on week, lab three, which will be due next Monday at 7pm.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/summer2021/20210621/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
