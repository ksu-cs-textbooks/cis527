#### Video Script

Hello, and welcome to the week six announcements video for CIS 527 and CC510 in fall 2025. So, this week today, we're hosting our first discussion session just shortly after this video gets posted. So, make sure you get the questions in for that. Tomorrow is when the lab three quizzes are going to be due. And then you've got until next week to work on lab three. I'm not saying Tuesday, but lab three, I believe, is actually due next Wednesday. But the second discussion will be next Tuesday, so make sure you're watching out for that. 

So as you know, you're working on Lab 3, where we introduce core networking services. You're going to be setting IP addresses. You're going to be building DNS and DHCP servers, SNMP servers. Like I said last week, please take a look at the hints and diagrams at the end of this chapter in the textbook. There's lots of good information in there about what we're trying to do with this lab. And of course, when in doubt, please, please, please take some time and ask questions and get help if you get stuck. 

So lab three grading. This will be grading live like we did for the first lab. So you'll need to schedule a time with either Josh or myself sometime late this week or early next week. To do lab three grading, we want you to demonstrate the remote connections between your systems. So you should be able to use the remote desktop tool to remote into your Windows client. You should be able to use SSH to remote into your Ubuntu server. You should have a static IP on your Ubuntu server. You should have a DNS server that we can do lookups on. You should have a DHCP server that is running your network within your VM. And then you should be able to demonstrate that you can do an SNMP query and you have the pictures of that activity and the pictures of the Wireshark activity ready to go. So just be prepared for that. Lab 3 grading goes pretty quick. There's just a few things we want to test and make sure it all works before we move on. 

So then you're going to work on Lab 4. Lab 4 is about installing an Active Directory and an LDAP server for authentication. So you're going to create a virtual machine for Windows Server. You're going to configure some of your clients and interoperability. And then, of course, you want to make sure you make snapshots for this. Big thing for Lab 4 is follow the instructions. Make sure you make snapshots before you promote your Windows Server to Active Directory and before you try and configure OpenLDAP with SSH or SSL. Those are the two things that most people have trouble with. And then, of course, if you're running on Mac Silicon, this is where we hit the point where you need Windows Server. So far, I have heard from everybody that you have an alternative system that you can run on. If you do run into issues with this running on Mac Silicon chips, just let me know and we'll work around that. 

So as always, success in this class, you got to read things carefully, see my hints, use your resources. Big thing I want you to keep in mind is don't spin your wheels. If you've been working on something for about an hour or so, take a break, step away, think about it, reach out for help. We're here to help. So don't just sit there and spin your wheels for eight hours and not make any progress. That gets really frustrating. And sometimes it is possible that you run into problems that it's difficult to solve. So we're used to that. We will help you out. 

So today we've got our first guest speaker, which is Seth Galitzer. Seth Galitzer is the engineering IT manager for the Engineering College, formerly the CS admin for the computer science department for something like 17 years, I believe. He's a CS grad from here at K-State, and so he'll be speaking today at 2.30 on Zoom. It's the same Zoom we use for office hours. So make sure you get your questions in for that before we get to that session so you're ready to go. 

And then next week on Tuesday, we're going to have another speaker, Kyle Hutson. Kyle Hutson currently works at Lambda Labs, but he formerly worked at Canran, which is the internet service provider for K-State. And before that, he was a BayoCat sysadmin for about 12 years. So he's going to be here next Tuesday on October the 7th at 2.30. So make sure you're watching for that as well. 

Last big thing to cover, I'm going to be fully remote the rest of this week, Wednesday through Friday. That means my email responses will be a little bit slower because I'll be mainly able to check email in the mornings and evenings. I also will have blocked off my calendar just because I can't immediately respond to appointment requests. If you need an appointment with me, you can schedule with me via email and I will get back to you. Josh's calendar should be open for early grading on lab three if you get done early. Otherwise, we'll be available early next week for lab three grading. Not a problem. 

So other than that, hopefully things are going well. Feel free to keep in touch with me, all the different ways that you can keep in touch. But otherwise, hopefully things are going well in this lab. Hopefully it's not too frustrating. I know that this is where the class starts to get a little bit more difficult. So take your time, use your resources, let us know if you have any questions. But otherwise, best of luck, and I will see you again next week.
