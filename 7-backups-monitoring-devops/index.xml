In this module, we’ll discuss several additional topics related to system administration. Honestly, each of these items probably deserves a module unto themselves, if not an entire course. However, since I am limited in the amount of things I can reasonably cover in a single course, I’ve chosen to group these items together into this single module.
First, we’ll discuss DevOps, or development operations, a relatively new field blending the skills of both system administrators and software developers into a single unit.</description></item><item><title>DevOps</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/7-backups-monitoring-devops/02-devops/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/7-backups-monitoring-devops/02-devops/</guid><description>Resources Slides Extras - Git CS GitLab DevOps on Wikipedia Infrastructure as Code on Wikipedia What is DevOps? from Amazon Web Services What Is DevOps? from The Agile Admin DevOps: Breaking the Development-Operations Barrier from Atlassian Periodic Table of DevOps Tools from XebiaLabs The Ultimate DevOps Tool Chest from XebiaLabs webhook on GitHub webhook Hook Examples on GitHub Webhooks on GitLab Documentation Video Transcript One of the hottest new terms in system administration and software development today is DevOps.</description></item><item><title>ITIL</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/7-backups-monitoring-devops/03-itil/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/7-backups-monitoring-devops/03-itil/</guid><description>Resources Slides ITIL on Wikipedia ITIL from Axelos ISO/IEC 20000 on Wikipedia ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 from ISO What is IT Service Management (ITSM) from Atlassian What is ITSM?

The best way to accomplish this is to treat this assignment like a checklist and check things off as you complete them.
If you have any questions about these items or are unsure what they mean, please contact the instructor. Remember that part of being a system administrator (and a software developer in general) is working within vague specifications to provide what your client is requesting, so eliciting additional information is a very necessary skill.</description></item><item><title>Monitoring</title><link>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/7-backups-monitoring-devops/05-monitoring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/7-backups-monitoring-devops/05-monitoring/</guid><description>Resources Slides Best System Monitoring Tools for Windows &amp; Linux (Free &amp; Paid) from Comparitech Beocat System Monitor Video Transcript One major part of any system administrator’s job is to monitor the systems within an organization.
