This week, you’re working on lab 5, lab 5 is due on Friday. As before, you’ll need to schedule a grading time with either Josh or I to get your lab graded. Lab 5 is pretty straightforward to grade, we’re just going to check some settings on your digital ocean droplets, and then we’re going to make sure that you’ve set up a domain name and have HTTPS working, the Apache sites working, and the Docker sites working. It usually only takes a few minutes to grade if everything’s working correctly. So hopefully you get everything done. Lab 5 is usually a little bit of a downward curve on the difficulty in this class, so hopefully it goes well. Also, don’t forget, our third discussion session is coming up tomorrow, Wednesday this week at 2:30.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2024/week11/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
