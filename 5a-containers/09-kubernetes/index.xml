My video would have been very similar, but probably with fewer graphics and a bit more condensed.
I encourage you to watch the video above through at least the “Kubernetes Architecture” portion (around 35 minutes) to get a good feel for how Kubernetes builds upon what we’ve done in Docker and Docker Compose.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/5a-containers/09-kubernetes/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
