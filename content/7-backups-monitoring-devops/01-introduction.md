Welcome to module 4! In this module, we'll discuss how to use directory services to provide consistent user accounts and permissions across a number of systems. Specifically, we'll look at the Active Directory Domain Services for Windows, and the OpenLDAP implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for Ubuntu Linux.

In addition, we'll see how to configure clients to connect to each of those servers. Finally, I'll discuss some implementation concerns for interoperability, for instances where you'll have a heterogeneous network environment.

Many students have reported to me that this is one of the most difficult lab assignments in this course, as it can be very frustrating to get everything set up and working correctly the first time. As always, if you have any questions or run into issues, please post in the course discussion forums to get help. Good luck!
