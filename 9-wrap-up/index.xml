      <description>Video Transcript Congratulations! You made it through CIS 527. I hope that you&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed your time working on this course, and that you&amp;rsquo;ve found the material I covered to be as interesting and useful as I have. I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed putting it all together for you.
Now that the class is over, there are a few last-minute things that you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take care of. First, please complete the TEVAL survey as soon as you receive it in your email.</description>
