#### Video Script

This course makes extensive use of several features of Canvas which you may or may not have worked with before. To give you the best experience in this course, this video will briefly describe those features and the best way to access them.

When you first access the course on Canvas, you will be shown this homepage, with my contact information and any important information about the course. This is a quick, easy reference for you if you ever need to get in touch with me.

Let's walk through the options in the main menu to the left. First, any course announcements will be posted in the Announcements section, which is available here. Those announcements will also be configured to send emails to all students when they are posted, though in your personal Canvas settings you can disable email notifications if you so choose. Please make sure you check here often for any updates to course information.

The next section is Modules, which is where you'll primarily interact with the course. You'll notice that I've disabled several of the common menu items in this course, such as Files and Assignments. This is to simplify things for you as students, so you remember that all the course content is available in one place.

When you first arrive at the Modules section, you'll see all of the content in the course laid out in order. If you like, you can minimize the modules you aren't working on by clicking the arrow to the left of the module name.

As you look at each module, you'll see that it gives quite a bit of information about the course. At the top of each module is an item telling you what parts of the module you must complete to continue. In this case, it says "Complete All Items." Likewise, the following modules may list a prerequisite module, which you must complete before you can access it.

Within each module is a set of items, which must be completed in listed order. Under each item you'll see information about what you must do in order to complete that item. For many of them, it will simply say "view," which means you must view the item at least once to continue. Others may say "contribute," "submit," or give a minimum score required to continue. For assignments, it also helpfully gives the number of points available, and the due date.

Let's click on the first item, Course Introduction, to get started. You've already been to this page by this point. Most course pages will consist of an embedded video, followed by links to any resources used or referenced in the video, including the slides and a downloadable version of the video. Finally, a rough video script will be posted on the page for your quick reference.

While I cannot force you to watch each video in its entirety, I highly recommend doing so. The script on the page may not accurately reflect all of the content in the video, nor can it show how to perform some tasks which are purely visual.

When you are ready to move to the next step in a module, click the "Next" button at the bottom of the page. Canvas will automatically add "Next" and "Previous" buttons to each piece of content which is accessed through the Modules section, which makes it very easy to work through the course content. I'll click through a couple of items here.

At any point, you may click on the Modules link in the menu to the left to return to the Modules section of the site. You'll notice that I've viewed the first few items in the first module, so I can access more items here. This is handy if you want to go back and review the content you've already seen, or if you leave and want to resume where you left off. Canvas will put green checkmarks to the right of items you've completed.

Continuing down the menu to the left, you'll find links to the Piazza discussion forums for this course. If you have any questions about an assignment or would like to discuss any topic with your fellow classmates, this is a great place to do so. We'll talk more about Piazza in just a second.

Finally, you'll find the usual Canvas links to view your grades in the course, as well as a list of fellow students taking the course.

Let's go back to the Course Introduction page, and look at some of the features of the YouTube video player that may be useful to you as you go through this course.

When you load the player, it gives you a control toolbar at the bottom with several options. From here, you can restart the video, control playback speed, adjust the volume, enable subtitled captions, see information about the video, open the video in a new window, and more.

Every video in this course will have subtitles available, though the subtitles may be slightly garbled as they are automatically transcribed from the audio. I will do my best to edit them to be as accurate as possible. This will make the videos accessible to all students. In addition, studies have shown that a large number of video viewers prefer to have subtitles available even if they do not have any hearing impairment. So, please feel free to enable subtitles at any time.

In addition, I will attempt to speak as clearly as possible when creating the videos. If you feel that I am going too fast, or that you can keep up with me going more quickly, feel free to adjust the playback speed as needed. I have been known to absorb lecture videos at 1.5x playback speed myself, depending on the content.  

Finally, you are welcome to download the videos from YouTube if desired, based on your internet connection or other factors. If you are interested in getting these videos in another format, please contact me.

Now, let's click the Piazza link to look at the Piazza boards for this course. Piazza is an online discussion board specifically tailored for college classes. It supports many cool features such as custom markup for code and math snippets, as well as the ability to directly message all instructors in a course. We'll be using Piazza as the primary communication method in this class. In addition to hosting course discussions, we'll also use Piazza to make general announcements to the class.

Piazza's interface is very simple. On the left, you'll see a list of all current topics in the course. During the course, this is the best place to catch up on what's new. At the top, you can also click on one of several folders or options to add a filter to the list. Piazza also has a section to post course resources, but for this course we'll be using Canvas for all course materials.

The biggest thing you'll be using Piazza for is chatting with other students and the instructors. To start a new post, just click the **New Post** button at the top of the list. When you do, you'll be asked a few questions about your post. You may choose to post a *Question* if you are asking a question and would like a response, a *Note* that does not require a response but is helpful information for other students or the instructors, or a *Poll* if you have something to be voted on.

For *Questions* and *Notes*, you'll also be asked to choose who the post should be sent to. By default, it will be visible to the entire class. However, you can choose *Instructor(s)* to send that post just to the instructors and TAs of the course. This is a great way for you to send a question to every instructor at once, and one of us can reply quickly.

Next, for all posts, you'll be asked to select a folder to place the post in. Folders will help you and other students quickly find posts relevant to a particular topic, such as a homework assignment or a particular tool used in the course.

Finally, you can enter a title (or summary) and the details for your posts. Please try to make your title as descriptive as possible, as that will help instructors and fellow students find your post easily later on. Once you are ready, click the button at the bottom to submit your post to Piazza.

Before posting in Piazza, you should read the information in the Syllabus regarding netiquette. It gives some important information about our expectation for conduct online in this course. In general, be polite and use clear language, and you should be just fine.

To manage your Piazza account & notification settings, click the gear icon in the upper left. Here you can post a profile picture and update your personal information. In addition, you can manage your email settings. I usually recommend turning on the *Smart Digest* option for new questions and notes, but selecting *Real Time* for any questions or notes you follow. Don't worry, any important course announcements will be sent via email directly from Piazza so you won't miss a thing. You can also download the Piazza app for iPhone and Android to stay connected to the course anytime.

Finally, Piazza also has a very active career and recruiting interface. It is a great way to make yourself available to companies interested in hiring students who have a particular set of skills, such as programming. You can find more information about those features by clicking the links in the upper-right of the window.

Hopefully this gives you a good idea of the different resources available in this course. To complete the first module, click the next button below to continue with the next item.
