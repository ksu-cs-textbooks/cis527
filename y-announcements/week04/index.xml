So this week you should be working on the discussion questions for our first discussion this Wednesday, which will be hosted by Kyle Hutson. I’ll talk about him in just a second. Those questions are due about an hour before the session starts so that I can go through them, but you’re invited to attend live in person so you can see his presentation and ask him questions via Zoom and get your response points there as well.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week04/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
