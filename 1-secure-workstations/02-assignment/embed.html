The best way to accomplish this is to treat this assignment like a checklist and check things off as you complete them.</p><p>If you have any questions about these items or are unsure what they mean, please contact the instructor. Remember that part of being a system administrator (and a software developer in general) is working within vague specifications to provide what your client is requesting, so eliciting additional information is a very necessary skill.</p><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p><em>To be more blunt - this specification may be purposefully designed to be vague, and it is your responsibility to ask questions about any vagaries you find. Once you begin the grading process, you cannot go back and change things, so be sure that your machines meet the expected specification regardless of what is written here. &ndash;Russ</em></p></div></div><p>Also, to complete many of these items, you may need to refer to additional materials and references not included in this document. System administrators must learn how to make use of available resources, so this is a good first step toward that. Of course, there&rsquo;s always <a href=http://www.google.com rel=external target=_blank>Google</a>!</p><h4 id=time-expectation>Time Expectation</h4><p>This lab may take anywhere from <strong>1 - 6 hours</strong> to complete, depending on your previous experience working with these tools and the speed of the hardware you are using. Installing virtual machines and operating systems is very time-consuming the first time through the process, but it will be much more familiar by the end of this course.</p><h4 id=software>Software</h4><p>This lab is written with the expectation that most students will be using <strong>VMware Workstation</strong> or <strong>VMware Fusion</strong> to complete the assignment. That software is available free of charge on the Broadcom Website ( <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware+Workstation+Pro" rel=external target=_blank>Download Workstation</a> and <a href="https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/productdownloads?subfamily=VMware+Fusion" rel=external target=_blank>Download Fusion</a> ) and is free for personal and academic use, and it is highly recommended for students who are new to working with virtual machines, since most of the assignments in this class are tailored to the use of that platform.</p><p>If you are using another virtualization platform, you may have to adapt these instructions to fit. If you are unsure about any specification and how it applies to your setup, please contact the instructor.</p><p>You will also need installation media for the following operating systems:</p><ul><li><strong>Windows 11 Version 23H2</strong> or later - See the <a href=https://support.cs.ksu.edu/CISDocs/wiki/FAQ#MSDNAA rel=external target=_blank>Azure Dev Tools</a> page on the CS Support Wiki for instructions.<ul><li>Look for <strong>Windows 11 Education, Version 23H2</strong> on the list of software available on the Azure Dev Tools site.</li><li>File Name: <code>en-us_windows_11_consumer_editions_version_23h2_x64_dvd_8ea907fb.iso</code></li><li>SHA 256 Hash: <code>71a7ae6974866603d366a911b0c00eace476e0b49d12205d7529765cc50b4b39</code></li><li><em>Your file may vary as Microsoft constantly updates these installers.</em></li><li><em>You may choose to upgrade to a later version of Windows 11 while installing updates.</em></li></ul></li><li><strong>Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)</strong> or later - Download from <a href=https://ubuntu.com/download rel=external target=_blank>Ubuntu</a>, an official <a href=https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+cdmirrors rel=external target=_blank>Ubuntu Mirror</a> (this is usually the fastest option), or the <a href=https://mirror.cs.ksu.edu/ubuntu-releases/noble/ rel=external target=_blank>K-State CS Mirror</a> (this is great if you are on campus).<ul><li>File Name: <code>ubuntu-24.04-desktop-amd64.iso</code></li><li>SHA 256 Hash: <code>81fae9cc21e2b1e3a9a4526c7dad3131b668e346c580702235ad4d02645d9455</code></li><li><em>If a point release is available (ex: 24.04.1), feel free to us that version. <strong>Do not upgrade to a newer LTS or non-LTS release</strong> such as Ubuntu 24.10, as those versions may have significant changes that are not covered in these assignments.</em></li></ul></li></ul><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Prior Versions</div><div class=box-content><p>The original course materials were developed for Windows 10 Version 1803 and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

It should have 60 GB of storage available. If given the option, do not pre-allocate the storage, but do allow it to be separated into multiple files. This will make the VM easier to work with down the road. It should also have at least 2 GB of RAM. You may allocate more RAM if desired. You may also allocate additional CPU cores for better performance if desired.</p><p>Install Windows 11 in that virtual machine to a single partition. You may use the express settings when configuring Windows. <strong>Do not use a Microsoft account to sign in!</strong> Instead, create a local (non-Microsoft) account as defined below. You may also be asked to set the computer name, which is given below.</p><div class="box notices cstyle note"><div class=box-label><i class="fa-fw fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note</div><div class=box-content><p>Windows 11 has made it <strong>even more</strong> difficult to create a local account when installing.
