One of the most common of those is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP.
HTTP was developed by Tim Berners-Lee while he worked at CERN in the late 1980s as part of his project to build the World Wide Web. HTTP itself is an application-layer protocol that is built on top of the TCP transport-layer protocol. As with many early application-layer protocols, it is actually a text-based protocol, making it very easy to read and work with manually if desired. HTTP is the protocol used to access webpages on the World Wide Web. In fact, if you look at the address bar of most web browsers, you’ll still see http:// in front of web addresses, indicating that it is using the HTTP protocol to access that site.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/3-core-networking-services/13-http/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
