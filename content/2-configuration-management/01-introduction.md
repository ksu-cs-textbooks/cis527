{{% notice info "Puppet Learning VM Deprecated" %}}

_As of 2023, the Puppet Learning VM is no longer being maintained. The videos below demonstrate some of the features of Puppet, which can also be done on your Ubuntu VM after installing Puppet Agent. Unfortunately, it is not easily possible to simulate an enterprise Puppet setup without this VM, so I'll keep these videos up for demonstration purposes._ --Russ

#### Video Script

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we'll be discussing configuration management. The next video will define that concept in detail and give some additional background.

The lab assignment will have you work with Puppet to completely automate most of the tasks you performed in Lab 1. By doing so, hopefully you'll see the incredible power of using configuration management tools in your workflow as a system administrator.

For the lab, I chose to use the Puppet configuration management tool for a couple of reasons. First, they have an open source, community edition that is very powerful and easy to use, so there is no cost to get started. Secondly, their documentation and support is very well done, so you'll have plenty of ways to get help if you get stuck. Finally, they provide an easy to use learning VM that can walk you through the basics of Puppet quickly and easily.

To get started in this module, I recommend downloading the Puppet Learning VM at this URL. The link is also in the resources section below this video. It is a very large download, so I recommend starting it now so you are ready to go by the time you get to that point. A later video will discuss how to install and use that VM in detail.

Good luck!
