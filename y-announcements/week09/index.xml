So this week you should be working on getting lab 4 finished up. Because we had all the outages yesterday, I’ve moved the lab 4 quizzes to tomorrow, which is Wednesday. Today we have our third discussion, which will be today at 2.30 that I’ll talk about briefly. Lab 4 is due this Friday. And then next Tuesday, we’re going to have our second discussion that I will also talk about briefly. So the schedule is a little weird. Hopefully it all makes sense. And all of these dates should also be accurate on Canvas.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week09/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
