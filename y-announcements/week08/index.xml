So we don’t really have anything due this week, but next week on Monday are the quizzes for lab 4. Then next Tuesday we’re going to have the third discussion with the current BayoCat sysadmins. And then lab four is going to be due a week from this Friday on the 24th. Then on Tuesday the 28th right before Halloween we’re going to have our second discussion which is Kyle Hudson. But there’s nothing available and nothing due this week. I just want you to get started on lab four and start working on that because it is one of the harder and more time consuming labs for this semester. So make sure you get started on that soon.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/week08/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
