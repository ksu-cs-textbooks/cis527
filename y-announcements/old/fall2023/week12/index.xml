As you can tell, I’ve been a little under the weather, so my voice is a little rough. I apologize for that. This week we’ve got a discussion three coming up with Sarah Allen. She’ll be here next Thursday, so please make sure you mark that on your calendar. You’ve got until next Wednesday to come up with a couple of questions. You’d like to ask Sarah based on her experience working as a system administrator for McCown -Gordon. After her presentation, you’ll have a couple of weeks to work on a response if you weren’t able to attend in person. Lab 6, the quizzes are due this week and then Lab 6 is due next week. Lab 6 is kind of one of the big wrap -up labs where we talk about big things like file servers, mapping drives to those file servers, creating application servers, and building some working web applications. It’s like three or four different things that we all do in different ways, but this uses all your VMs and your digital ocean droplets as well.</description><generator>Hugo</generator><language>en-us</language><atom:link href="https://textbooks.cs.ksu.edu/cis527/y-announcements/old/fall2023/week12/index.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/></channel></rss>
