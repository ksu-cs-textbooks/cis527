      <description>Resources Slides Syllabus Video Script Welcome to CIS 527 - Enterprise System Administration and CC 510 - Computer Systems Administration. Even though these are two different courses in the catalog, they teach the same content and will use the same Canvas course. So, anywhere you see CIS 527 in this course, you can also mentally substitute CC 510 in its place.
My name is Russell Feldhausen, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be your instructor for this course.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Transcript Welcome to Module 7! In this module, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss several additional topics related to system administration. Honestly, each of these items probably deserves a module unto themselves, if not an entire course. However, since I am limited in the amount of things I can reasonably cover in a single course, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to group these items together into this single module.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss DevOps, or development operations, a relatively new field blending the skills of both system administrators and software developers into a single unit.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Video Script Hello, and welcome to the week four announcements for cis 527 in summer 2021. I&amp;rsquo;m a bit informal this week because I decided not to set up all my recording equipment just to do my announcements this week, but I hope you can bear with me. So this week, we&amp;rsquo;ve got lab three, it&amp;rsquo;s due tonight by 7pm. This lab does require live grading. So if you haven&amp;rsquo;t scheduled a time to meet with me already, please do so as soon as you can.</description>

      <description>It appears that I have managed to confuse lots of people with the Windows AD portion of this lab. That&amp;rsquo;s not my intent, and any confusion is totally my fault here. This is mostly due to the fact that I reused an older video showing how to set up an Active Directory server and not clearly describing how things should be changed. I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to clarify what you need to know and how you can adapt any existing setup you may have so that it works.</description>

      <description>Here are some helpful networking diagrams to better explain the desired state before and after the end of Lab 4. In all of these diagrams, I am using a sample network with the IP address 192.168.40.0. You will have to adapt the IPs to match your network configuration. In addition, each network address will need to be updated with your unique eID as directed in the lab assignment.
After Lab 3 Once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed all of Lab 3, your network diagram should resemble the one shown above.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on Wikipedia Video Transcript Next, let&amp;rsquo;s review a couple of application layer protocols. One of the most common of those is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP.
HTTP was developed by Tim Berners-Lee while he worked at CERN in the late 1980s as part of his project to build the World Wide Web. HTTP itself is an application-layer protocol that is built on top of the TCP transport-layer protocol.</description>

First, let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at processes. Recall from the earlier video on Windows Processes and Services that a process is a program running in the foreground for the user, while a service is a program running in the background for the operating system.</description>

      <description>As I was reworking this lab for the Summer 2020 semester, I ran into a few issues getting my own bind9 server to work. In doing so, I ended up taking some great screenshots of common misconfigurations of bind9 and the related output from using the dig command to diagnose the issue. I figured it would be helpful to share those screenshots here to give you a nice guide to some common errors you may encounter when working with bind9.</description>

      <description>Video Transcript Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and talk through a model solution version of lab three and give you some advice on how to go about this lab. And also how to verify that you got this lab configured and working properly. So the first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to do is we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at our IP address. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to go to the Edit menu in VMware and then choose virtual network editor.</description>

      <description>Resources Slides Networking, Web &amp;amp; Email from Ubuntu Networking from Ubuntu Server Guide Internet and Networking from Ubuntu UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) from Ubuntu GUFW (Graphical Interface for UFW) from Ubuntu Video Script In this last video on Ubuntu, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss some important security and networking details needed to finish getting your VMs set up and configured properly.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about security. Whenever you install a new operating system, there are 4 major steps you should always perform before doing just about anything else on the system.</description>

      <description>Here are some helpful networking diagrams to better explain the desired state before and after the end of Lab 3. In all of these diagrams, I am using a sample network with the IP address 192.168.40.0. You will have to adapt the IPs to match your network configuration. In addition, each network address will need to be updated with your unique eID as directed in the lab assignment.
Before Lab 3 Once you&amp;rsquo;ve completed Task 1 of Lab 3, you should have three virtual machines connected to your network.</description>

      <description>Our board has recently been discussing the topic of stewardship, and we spent quite a bit of time discussing what the word stewardship actually means. As it turns out, that word can have many connotations and different meanings for different people.
For me, good stewardship is about caring for the church and the larger community, making sure they both have the resources needed to do the good work and be the change that we all wish to see in the world.</description>
